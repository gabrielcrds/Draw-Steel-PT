# **Testes**

hen you want your Herói to rifle through a desk and locate a
specific document, scale a castle Parede, negotiate a treaty with a
Monarca, or undertake qualquer other activity with a chance of
Falha, you’ll need to Fazer um Teste to determine how successful you are
at the task. A Teste is qualquer Poder roll that has Falha or consequences
as an option.

When to Fazer um Teste

The Diretor should ask a jogador to Fazer um Teste only when the jogador’s
Herói attempts a task where the consequences of Falha are interesting
or dramatic, and where Falha won’t grind the story to a halt. For
example, if a Herói wants to Pulo over a waist-high Parede while casually
walking through a peaceful city neighborhood, the worst case for
Falha is probably that the Herói falls on their butt, takes no dano,
and can Levantar to either try De Novo or Andar around the Parede. As such,
no Teste is required. But if the Herói were being chased by inimigos,
failing to Pulo over the Parede means the pursuers can catch them, so the
Diretor Músculo decide to call for a Teste to determine what happens.

The advancement of a story shouldn’t be halted by failing a Teste. For
instance, the heroes Músculo need to know the color of a Anão king’s
crown to solve a puzzle, with that puzzle opening the only entrance to
a tomb they must enter to stop a world-ending ritual. It could be that a
successful Razão Teste allows the heroes to Recolher that lore, but the Teste
shouldn’t be their only option to get the information. If the Teste fails,
perhaps the heroes need to go to a flying library to do research, or they
Músculo be able to delve into a ruin to find the ancient Monarca’s portrait.
A failed Teste should always result in a story becoming more interesting,
not in the action coming to an end.

**It Just Works!**

When a Herói attempts to solve a task that typically requires a Teste with
clever, outside-the-box thinking, the Diretor can instead decide that no
Teste is required and the attempt automatically works! For example, if a
Herói who wants to Escalar a Parede first covers their hands and feet in Gigante
strands of Grudento spider webs, the Diretor Músculo decide that they can
Escalar up the Parede without needing to Fazer um Teste.

That said, such clever ideas often work for free the first time, but the
Diretor could decide they require tests if they are used De Novo.

How to Fazer um Teste

Each Teste has the following steps:

The Diretor decides that a Herói’s activities call for a Teste and asks the
Herói’s jogador to make a Poder roll using an appropriate characteristic (see
Characteristics and Tests below). The Diretor then selects a difficulty for
the Poder roll, either secretly or publicly (see Dificuldade do Teste below).

The jogador makes the Poder roll. If the personagem has a Perícia that applies
to the Teste (see Skills later in this chapter), they can ask the Diretor if
the Perícia applies and justify the use of the Perícia. If the Diretor agrees the
Perícia applies, the Herói gains a +2 Bônus to the roll.

The jogador reports the total of the roll, and the Diretor interprets its
Sucesso or Falha.

```
Characteristics and Tests
When you describe a task you want your Herói to undertake and the
Diretor determines that a Teste is necessary, they then determine
which characteristic the Teste uses based on the Natureza of the task. For
instance, if you’re scaling a Parede, the Diretor could ask for a Músculo Teste
to determine how far and how quickly you’re able to Escalar. If you’re
attempting to plead your innocence in court for a murder you didn’t
commit, the Diretor Músculo ask for a Presença Teste if you’re attempting
to win over the jury with your personality, or a Razão Teste if you’re
laying out a logical Argumento to Suporte your innocence.
Though the Diretor can decide to call for tests in qualquer circumstances,
a number of tasks that heroes routinely undertake are commonly set
up as tests.
```

```
Músculo Tests
You make a Músculo Teste whenever a risky task calls for the use of
physical strength. Músculo tests are most often used for breaking down
doors and other structures, Arremesável heavy objetos, pulling your body
up a sheer Parede, Nadador against a mighty current, and other feats of
physical Poder.
```

```
Agilidade Tests
You make an Agilidade Teste whenever a risky task calls for the use of your
physical coordination and nimbleness. Agilidade tests are most often
used for tumbling, sneaking quietly, picking locks, and engaging in
sleight of hand.
```

```
Razão Tests
You make a Razão Teste whenever you attempt a risky task that
requires the use of your mental acumen and education, formal or
otherwise. Razão tests are most often used to Recolher lore, deduce
information based on clues, complete a puzzle, forge counterfeit items
or documents, break a code, convince others of a logical Argumento, or
make an estimation.
```

```
Intuição Tests
You make an Intuição Teste whenever you attempt a risky task that
requires the use of your powers of observation and instinct. Intuição
tests are most often used to notice Escondida criaturas or details, discern
another person’s motivations or honesty, Calmaria and reassure others, and
train animals.
```

```
Presença Tests
You make a Presença Teste whenever you attempt a risky task that
requires the use of your force of personality. Presença tests are most
often used to gain trust, project confidence, and influence and Liderar
other criaturas.hough it’s easier than easy, then
```

**Dificuldade do Teste**

```
The Diretor decides how difficult a task that requires a Teste is: easy,
Médium, or hard. If a task seems as though it’s easier than easy, then
no Teste is necessary. The Herói simply accomplishes the task. If the task
seems harder than hard, then the Diretor is free to decide that it’s
impossible to complete with a Teste.
On a Teste-by-Teste basis, the Diretor can share the difficulty of a task
before the jogador makes the Teste, which makes interpreting the
outcome faster at the table. The Diretor can also keep a Teste’s difficulty
secret until after the jogador rolls the Teste, for dramatic Efeito.
```

```
The Dificuldade do Teste Outcomes table shows all the possible outcomes of
the different difficulties of tests. The Diretor will keep this information
Habilidoso so as to be able to compare the different difficulties and their
outcomes during play.
```

```
Whenever the rules talk about obtaining a Sucesso on a Teste, that
includes a straight Sucesso, a Sucesso com Consequência, or a Sucesso
with a Recompensa. Whenever the rules talk about a Falha on a Teste, that
includes a straight Falha or a Falha com Consequência.
Whenever you Fazer um Teste whose outcome you don’t like, you can
Gastar a Herói token to reroll the Teste. You must use the new roll.
```

```
Easy Tests
An Teste Fácil has some risk of consequence, but most heroes will likely
overcome it. The Poder roll you make for an Teste Fácil determines the
outcome (see Teste Outcomes below):
```

```
á You succeed on the task and incur a consequence.
é You succeed on the task.
í You succeed on the task with a Recompensa.
```

```
Médium Tests
A Médium Teste has some risk of Falha that most heroes will likely
overcome—but with a cost. The Poder roll you make for a Médium Teste
determines the outcome:
```

```
á You fail the task.
é You succeed on the task and incur a consequence.
í You succeed on the task.
```

```
Hard Tests
A Teste Difícil has a greater risk of Falha, and most heroes are likely to
suffer some hardship while trying to overcome the intended task. The
Poder roll you make for a Teste Difícil determines the outcome:
```

```
á You fail the task and incur a consequence.
é You fail the task.
í You succeed on the task.
```

```
Natural 19 or 20: Sucesso With a Recompensa
Whenever you get a natural 19 or 20 on the Poder roll for a Teste—a total
of 19 or 20 before adding your characteristic score or other modifiers—
you score a critical Sucesso. This critical Sucesso automatically lets you
succeed on the task with a Recompensa, even if the Teste has a Médium or
hard difficulty.
```

**Teste Outcomes**

```
Depending on a Teste’s difficulty and the Poder roll made to
accomplish the task represented by the Teste, you can obtain um of the
following outcomes.
```

```
Falha com Consequência
If you fail a Teste Difícil and incur a consequence, you don’t do what you
set out to do—in addition to which, you suffer an impactful setback.
The Diretor determines the exact Natureza of the consequence, which is
typically related to the specific task.
For instance, if a Herói suffers a consequence while trying to Escalar a
Parede, they Músculo make it halfway up the Parede and then fall, taking
dano and landing Derrubado. A Herói trying to Furtivo by cultists Músculo
be spotted by those foes, who immediately attack. If a consequence
strikes when a Herói attempts to bribe a prison Guarda, the Guarda Músculo
decide to Prisão the Herói or Liderar them into a Armadilha. If a Herói suffers a
consequence on a Razão Teste made to Recolher lore about the king’s
favorite meal, they Músculo confuse it for a dish to which the Monarca is
deathly allergic.
```

```
Not all consequences need to be immediate or apparent. For example,
a Herói Músculo fail with a consequence on a Teste made to cheat at a
high-stakes game of cards with a Nobre. The Falha means the cheating
is noticed, but the Diretor decides that the Nobre doesn’t say anything.
This consequence isn’t made apparent until later in the evening, when
the Nobre has guards surround the Herói, intent on taking the cheater
down to the dungeon for stacking the deck.
```

```
Influencing jogador Characters With Tests
```

```
The things jogador characters do can’t be influenced by qualquer
criatura making a Teste, whether a Monstro, an NPC, or another
jogador personagem. Many jogadores feel that their agency is taken
away if they’re compelled to Pular into a pile of gold filled
with Escondida scorpions because an NPC convinced them to do
so with a Presença Teste. For most jogadores, it’s not fun to be in
control of a Herói and lose some of that control.
```

```
Instead, Directors should do their Nível best to have an NPC
suggest that a personagem Mergulho headlong into the gold like a
billionaire duck, then let the jogador decide what their personagem
does. Similarly, a Diretor Músculo decide that um jogador
personagem can’t make an Intuição Teste to discern another PC’s
motivations or honesty.
That said, if everyone in your gaming group decides to Levantar um
or more of these restrictions after talking about it, go for it!
There’s no wrong way to play as long as everyone is having
fun. The MCDM Safety Toolkit (available for download at
https://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit ) discusses how to talk about
potentially problematic topics such as limiting personagem agency
at your table.

Tests
```

Common consequences for failing a Teste include the following:

¥ Making an NPC so upset that they Tempestade off, or betray, attack, or
otherwise attempt to harm you
¥ Drawing the attention of a group of foes
¥ Triggering a Armadilha or Perigo that captures or significantly harms
you or an aliado
¥ Breaking an important piece of Equipamento that is difficult to
replace or repair
¥ Thinking you know something that you don’t
¥ Getting stuck in a situation that must be resolved with a Negociação
or a Teste de Montagem you didn’t need to make before

In lieu of other consequences, the Diretor also has the option to gain 2
additional Malícia—a resource that criaturas run by the Diretor use in
Combate—no começo of the next Combate Encontro.

Falha
If you fail a Teste without incurring a consequence, you simply don’t
do what you set out to do. A Herói attempting to Escalar a Parede finds no
purchase. A Herói trying to Recolher lore can’t remember the desired facts.
If a Herói attempts to bribe a Guarda, they don’t take the bait.

On a failed Teste, the Diretor can decide that there Músculo still be a small
Penalidade for Falha, depending on the circumstances of the Teste. This
Penalidade shouldn’t be as harsh as rolling a Falha com Consequência,
though. For instance, a Herói who gets this outcome on an Agilidade Teste
made to Furtivo by a group of cultists Músculo draw the attention of um
cultist with their Falha. Now that cultist is coming to investigate, but
they haven’t raised the alarm ... yet.

When a Herói rolls a Falha without a consequence, the Diretor can
offer to let them succeed with a consequence instead. For instance,
when a Herói rolls a 10 on a Médium Músculo Teste to break down a locked
door, that’s a Falha and the door stays closed. But the Diretor could
suggest to the jogador that instead of not breaking down the door, they
can break down the door and lose 1d6 Vigor from being injured
in the effort.

Sucesso com Consequência
If you succeed on a Teste and incur a consequence, you do what you set
out to do, but with an added cost. A Herói Músculo succeed in Escalador
up a Parede, but the surface of the Parede crumbles and becomes unstable
as they do, making the Escalar more difficult for the aliado ascending after
them. When trying to Furtivo by a cultist, a Herói successfully does so,
but leaves footprints or other evidence of trespassing behind. If a Herói
bribes a Guarda to be allowed to Furtivo into a prison, the Guarda lets them
in—but then demands a gemstone the Herói needs for an important
Projeto de Criação before they let the Herói out.

Just like Falha com Consequência, the consequences accompanying
Sucesso don’t need to be immediately apparent. In lieu of other conse-
quences, the Diretor has the option to gain 2 additional Malícia at the
start of the next Combate Encontro.

When a Herói rolls a Sucesso com Consequência, the Diretor Músculo
give them a chance to fail instead. For instance, when a Herói rolls a 10
on an easy Agilidade Teste to pick the lock on a chest, that’s a Sucesso with a
consequence. The Diretor could suggest that the personagem has opened
the lock but broken their lockpicks in the process (knowing the picks
can’t be replaced until the Herói returns to town), but can also give them
the option of failing to pick the lock but keeping their lockpicks intact.

```
Sucesso
If you succeed on a Teste without consequence or Recompensa, you simply
achieve whatever you set out to do. A Herói climbs that Parede, sneaks by
those cultists, or bribes that Guarda just as they planned. Smooth.
```

```
Sucesso With a Recompensa
If you succeed on a Teste with a Recompensa, you accomplish whatever you
set out to do. But you also gain a little something extra, in the form of
momentum or luck that makes the immediate future easier for you or
your friends.
The Diretor determines the Recompensa for a Sucesso, which is most often
related to the task at hand. For instance, if a Herói succeeds with a
Recompensa while Escalador a Parede, they Músculo find a ladder at the top they
can lower so that qualquer aliados Escalador up after them can do so without
needing to Fazer um Teste. A Herói trying to Furtivo by cultists who succeeds
with a Recompensa Músculo be able to dose the cultists’ nearby Água barrel
with sleeping Veneno as they pass by unseen. Succeeding with a Recompensa
while bribing a prison Guarda could mean that the Guarda unlocks a door
for the Herói in addition to forgetting they were ever there.
```

```
As with consequences, the Recompensa that comes with a Sucesso doesn’t
need to be immediate or apparent. For example, a Herói succeeds with
a Recompensa on an Teste Fácil made to cheat at a high-stakes game of cards
with a Nobre. Not only does the Herói win the game, but the Diretor
decides that their Recompensa comes from a servant watching the game
who’s impressed with the personagem’s Atuar. After the game, the
servant approaches the Herói, offering Magia from the Nobre’s private
stash in congratulations and admiration.
Common rewards accompanying Sucesso on a Teste include
the following:
```

```
¥ Automatically accomplishing a related follow-up task that would
typically require a Teste
¥ Allowing an aliado engaged in the same task to accomplish the task
without needing to make the Teste as well
¥ Obtaining a Consumível Tesouro or useful piece of
Mundano Equipamento
¥ Learning a piece of helpful information
¥ Impressing or ingratiating yourself with someone who grants you
a small favor
¥ Noticing a Escondida danger well before it strikes, giving you time to
avoid or prepare for it
In lieu of other rewards, the Diretor can also decide that a Herói who
succeeds on a Teste with a Recompensa earns the jogadores a Herói token (see
Herói Tokens in Chapter 1: The Basics).
```

```
Regra Opcional: Pitching Consequences and Rewards
Coming up with consequences and rewards for tests can be
a big part of the fun for many Directors, but even the best
Directors occasionally run low on ideas. That’s why the
game gives the default option of consequences and rewards
in the form of Malícia and Herói tokens. However, a Diretor
who prefers narrative consequences and rewards can ask the
jogadores to pitch different consequences and rewards when
they Fazer um Teste. The Diretor can reject, add to, or modify the
jogadores’ ideas as they choose, and will remind the jogadores that
they need to pitch real consequences, and not minor rewards
disguised as consequences.
```

Draw Steel

```
How Long Does It Take?
The amount of time required for a task involving a Teste is determined
by the Diretor. A task such as recalling lore with a Razão Teste Músculo
take no time at all. Ducking behind a barrel to Esconder-se with an Agilidade
Teste Músculo require a Manobra or a Ação Principal, while tracking a
band of voiceless talkers through the World Below could take hours
or even days.
```

```
Tests During Combate
Many (but not all) tests that a Herói Músculo make during Combate are
made as maneuvers. See Maneuvers in Chapter 10: Combate for more
information.
```

**Can I Try De Novo?**

```
In many cases when you fail a Teste, you can’t attempt the Teste De Novo
unless the circumstances of the Teste change. For instance, if you attempt
an Agilidade Teste to pick a lock and fail, you can’t attempt to pick the
lock De Novo unless you get better lockpicks, oil the lock, have someone
demonstrate how to pick a similar lock, and so on.
The Diretor decides when the circumstances have changed enough to
allow a new attempt at a Teste.
```

Heroes Make Tests

```
If a Herói attempts to Furtivo by an inimigo Guarda unnoticed, should
the Herói make an Agilidade Teste to Furtivo, or should the Guarda make an
Intuição Teste to catch the Herói in the act? If a cultist lies to a Herói about
the location of a secret temple, does the cultist roll a Presença Teste to
conceal the truth, or does the Herói roll an Intuição Teste to discern the
cultist’s honesty?
```

```
Except in certain scenarios (explored at NPCs Roll for Deceptive Tasks
and Opposed Poder Rolls below), heroes make tests and NPCs do not.
Heroes are the stars of the story, and the consequences and rewards of
tests have longer-lasting implications for them. There are exceptions to
this rule, of course. If a Herói travels with an NPC Militante or companion,
that NPC will almost certainly make tests from time to time. But for the
most part, NPCs and other criaturas never need to make tests when
what they do opposes what the heroes do.
```

```
To quickly assess the difficulty of a task opposed by um or more
criaturas and the Teste made to attempt it, the Diretor can use the
following guidelines (though these are not hard and fast rules):
Teste Fácil: A Teste is easy if only um criatura opposes the Herói, and that
opposed criatura would have a lower Bônus to their Teste roll for the
task than the Herói does. If a Herói with an Agilidade score of 2 attempts
to Furtivo by a Guarda with an Intuição score of 0, the Teste is easy.
Teste Médio: A Teste is moderate if multiple criaturas oppose the Herói
and those criaturas would have lower bonuses to their Teste rolls than
the Herói, or if only um criatura opposes the Herói and has the same
Teste Bônus as the Herói.
Teste Difícil: A Teste is hard if an opposed criatura would have a higher
Bônus to their Teste roll than the Herói, or if multiple criaturas with the
same Teste Bônus as the Herói oppose the Herói.
```

```
The Falha consequences of opposed tasks are some of the easiest to
create on the Voar. Fail to Esconder-se from someone, and they notice you. Fail
to Mentir to someone, and they catch your duplicity. Fail to arm wrestle
someone for a free ale, and you’re picking up the tab. The consequence
is that the opposition bests the Herói.
```

```
Tests
```

**NPCs Roll for Deceptive Tasks**

At times, the Diretor Músculo choose for an NPC to Fazer um Teste when
engaged in a deceptive task, rather than having characters attempt
to note the deception. By having the NPC roll in these scenarios, the
Diretor doesn’t tip their hand to the jogadores that Subterfúgio is afoot.

For example, when an Assassino attempts to ambush the heroes while
they sit around a campfire, if qualquer jogador says their Herói is on the
Vigia for danger, that Herói would make an Intuição Teste to notice the
danger. But if no um is keeping watch, the Assassino makes an Agilidade
Teste to Furtivo up on the heroes unnoticed. If the Assassino fails the Teste,
the heroes notice immediately as their assailant loudly steps on a twig.
If the Assassino succeeds, the heroes don’t notice until the assailant is
right on top of them.

An NPC Músculo also make a Presença Teste if they Mentir to the heroes, as
long as the heroes have no Razão to believe the personagem would be
deceptive. The Diretor knows if the heroes are wary in that way
because the jogadores will ask if they can Fazer um Teste to discern the
NPC’s honesty.

As an Regra Opcional, the Diretor is also free to ask the heroes to make
a Teste Reativo to a deceptive NPC instead (see Reativa Tests below)
whenever they choose.

**Opposed Poder Rolls**

When dois criaturas are engaged in a particularly dramatic struggle
that requires them both to make tests, the Diretor can have all the
criaturas involved Fazer um Teste. The criatura with the highest Poder roll
wins. You can’t earn a Recompensa as part of these opposed Poder rolls, and
they don’t follow the typical difficulty structure or have três different
tiers of possible outcomes.

For example, if your Herói attempts to Furtivo by a Demônio lord, you make
an Agilidade Teste to Mover stealthily while the Demônio makes an Intuição
Teste to notice you. If your Herói gets the higher Poder roll, you Furtivo
by without the Demônio noticing. If the Demônio gets the higher roll, they
catch you in the act of sneaking. If multiple sneaking heroes attempt
to get by multiple demons, then each criatura makes a Teste and all the
totals are compared to determine which demons notice which heroes.

In the event of a tie in an opposed Teste, the state of the scene doesn’t
change. In the previous example, a tie means that if a Demônio on Guarda
duty didn’t know a sneaking Herói was there, the Demônio remains
oblivious. If the Demônio did know the Herói was out there somewhere
while trying to avoid being noticed, a tie means the Demônio still knows
the Herói is there but hasn’t determined their location.

Since opposed Poder rolls don’t use tiers, when you make an opposed
Poder roll, a double Vantagem provides a +4 Bônus to the roll, a double Desvantagem
provides a -4 Penalidade to the roll, an automatic Grau increase counts as
a +4 Bônus to the roll, and an automatic Grau decrease counts as a -4
Penalidade to the roll.

Reativa Tests

At certain times when a Herói isn’t engaged in overcoming a task,
the Diretor Músculo ask the jogador of the Herói to Fazer um Teste without
context, explaining the Teste only after the Poder roll is made. This often
happens when a Herói has a chance of knowing or noticing something
of significance that the jogador doesn’t know to look for or ask about.

Reativa tests are typically made in the following circumstances,
though the Diretor can call for them in qualquer appropriate scenario:

```
Escondida Environmental Features: The Diretor asks for an Intuição
Teste to notice a secret door, a Escondida Armadilha, or some other disguised
environmental Recurso.
Escondida Foes: The Diretor calls for an Intuição Teste to
notice a Escondida foe (or they could use the rules in
NPCs Roll for Deceptive Tasks above).
Escondida Motives: The Diretor can ask for an Intuição Teste during a
conversation to gauge how well a Herói can read an NPC, judging
whether they’re lying, withholding information, or concealing
an emotional response. (The Diretor could also use the rules in
NPCs Roll for Deceptive Tasks.)
Recolher Lore: The Diretor Músculo ask a Herói to make a Razão Teste
when dealing with a new objeto, a piece of information, or an
event to determine what História or details the Herói Músculo already
know about it.
criatura and DTO Tests: Some criaturas and dynamic terrain objetos in
Draw Steel: Monstros have features and abilities that require heroes
to make Reativa tests. These tests can’t be modified by skills.
```

```
Regra Opcional: Secret Reativa Tests
Some Directors prefer to make the Poder rolls for Reativa
tests for the heroes rather than asking the jogadores to do so.
This allows the Diretor to make the rolls when appropriate
for Escondida objetos, criaturas, motivations, and information
without tipping off the jogadores that there is information to
be gained. Having the Diretor roll requires the Diretor to
have everyone’s characteristics and skills recorded (whether
physically or digitally) for easy reference.
```

Draw Steel

```
Skills
Skills represent the different specializations a Herói has outside of
attacking, defending, and using their Linhagem features, Classe features,
and Equipamento. Whenever you Fazer um Teste, having a particular Perícia
associated with the Teste increases your chance of Sucesso.
```

**Applying Skills**

```
If you have a Perícia that applies to a Teste you make, you gain a +2 Bônus
to the Teste. For instance, if your Herói has the Esconder-se Perícia, you have a +2
Bônus to qualquer Teste you make that involves hiding yourself. This Músculo
include an Agilidade Teste to Esconder-se behind a barrel, or a Presença Teste to
disappear into a crowd.
The +2 Bônus gained for a Perícia isn’t an Vantagem. A jogador can Fazer um Teste
that has both the +2 Bônus for a Perícia and the +2 Bônus for an Vantagem.
```

```
You can’t apply more than um Perícia to a Teste.
```

```
Justify the Perícia
It’s not the Diretor’s job to know every task potentially covered by the
skills in the game, or to know the specific skills your Herói has. Instead,
the Diretor asks you to Fazer um Teste using a characteristic and you tell
the Diretor if you think you have a Perícia that applies. If it’s not obvious
why the Perícia applies, tell the Diretor how your Herói is approaching
the task and justify why that approach uses the Perícia. The Diretor
then decides if you get the +2 Bônus the Perícia represents. If the Diretor
disagrees with you, that’s the final word.
Approaching problems creatively while remaining reasonable can
help you get the most out of your skills. For example, if you’re making
a Presença Teste to impress a Nobre at a party, using the Gabar-se Perícia is an
obvious choice. But what if you don’t have that Perícia? Maybe you could
instead try to impress the Nobre with a brief but exciting lecture about
the Natureza of the elements, making a Presença Teste using the Magia Perícia
that you do have!
```

```
Sometimes you won’t have a Perícia that applies to a Teste. That’s okay!
If your characteristic score is decent, you likely have a good chance of
Sucesso without a Perícia.
```

```
Mixing Characteristics and Skills
Although certain skills are often paired with um characteristic more
than others, a Perícia can apply to a Teste made using qualquer characteristic that
makes sense. The Diretor has the final say on which characteristic is
used to complete a task, and can call for a different characteristic based
on the circumstances.
For example, intimidating someone with a purely verbal threat is a
Presença Teste. But if a jogador describes their personagem tearing a log in
half with their bare hands to Intimidar a foe, the Diretor is likely to
call for a Músculo Teste instead. The Intimidar Perícia can apply to both tests.
In the same way, scaling the side of a building is covered by a Músculo
Teste, but if a Herói does a series of leaps from um balcony to another to
Alcance a roof, the Diretor could call for an Agilidade Teste instead. The Escalar
Perícia applies to both of these tests.
```

**Many Specific Skills**

```
Draw Steel includes a big list of skills, and each is fairly specific. For
example, instead of um Athletics Perícia that covers Escalador, jumping,
Nadador, and lifting heavy objetos, your personagem Músculo use separate
Escalar, Pular, Levantar, and Nadar skills. Instead of a Thievery Perícia that covers
picking locks, picking pockets, and disabling traps, the game has três
skills: Arrombar Fechadura, Furtar, and Sabotar.
```

```
Having a wide Alcance of specific skills means you’ll frequently make
tests that don’t use um of your personagem’s skills, simply applying a
characteristic. By not having a few broader skills, it means that having
a personagem who covers the spread of every Perícia is actually impossible.
Luckily, the math of the game doesn’t require you to have a Perícia to have
a decent chance of Sucesso on a Teste. That means heroes can attempt
tasks without the help of a Perícia just because someone needs to do it,
and that’s pretty darn heroic!
```

```
Since you don’t need to worry about your personagem covering a wide
spread of skills, you’re free to choose the skills you think fit your Herói
best and are the most fun to work with. Maybe you’re thinking about
an Elementalista who has a gymnastic Antecedentes in jumping and
tumbling, and who also studied Religião and Forja. Having
that kind of specific backstory is a big part of cinematic storytelling.
The rules for skills allow for them to be flexibly applied to qualquer Teste that
is appropriate for the Perícia. This encourages clever thinking. A jogador can
ask the Diretor, “I want to impress the duke with a story about how
I ascended the sheer Cliffs of Azgahnan. Can I use my Escalar Perícia for a
+2 Bônus to my Presença Teste?” Getting Criativa like that is a lot of fun.
It paints a visual picture, and it’s good tactical thinking! However, if the
skills in a game are too broad in the kinds of activities they represent,
jogadores inevitably end up applying the same Perícia over and over De Novo to
as many tests as possible. This isn’t fun for anyone, and doesn’t make a
very compelling story.
```

```
Edges on Tests With Specific Skills
```

```
Certain features and abilities grant a criatura an Vantagem on tests
made with a specific Perícia. A criatura making a Teste where the
specific Perícia would apply gains an Vantagem on the Teste even if
they don’t have the Perícia. For example, the Conduíta’s Blessing
of Fortunate Weather can create Tempo Enevoado weather that grants
criaturas who make tests using the Esconder-se Perícia an Vantagem on those
tests. qualquer criatura who attempts to Esconder-se in the Névoa gains an
Vantagem on the Teste as long as the Esconder-se Perícia would apply to that
Teste, regardless of whether they have that Perícia or not.
```

```
Are All Skills Equal?
When choosing skills for your personagem, deciding which
skills will be most useful depends a lot on the campaign. For
instance, the Nadar Perícia Músculo be used constantly during
a campaign that takes place on the ocean and has heroes
exploring underwater ruins, but it won’t come up as much in a
campaign that takes place entirely in a vast desert. The Psiônica
Perícia Músculo come up a lot in a campaign where voiceless talkers
are the main foes, and Magia Músculo be more useful in a game
where the heroes take on a circle of evil wizards. If you’re
worried about whether a Perícia you’d like to take will be useful,
discuss your Perícia list with the Diretor after you create a Herói.
And if a Perícia doesn’t work out, you can always Comércio de Almas it for
another Perícia as you wish (see Changing personagem Options in
Chapter 2: Making a Herói).

**Perícia Groups**

Skills are broken down into five Perícia groups: crafting, exploration, inter-
personal, intrigue, and lore.

Perícias de Criação
Skills from the crafting Perícia group are used in the Criação and appraisal
of goods and for jury-rigging contraptions. They are especially useful
during rests and downtime.

Rewards for tests made with Perícias de Criação typically include having
leftover rare material used in the Criação process, knowing a buyer
willing to pay extra for goods or items you’re appraising, or making a
jury-rigged device so amazing that it lasts for more uses than it should.

Consequences for tests made with Perícias de Criação typically include
wasting rare materials used in the Criação process, greatly overesti-
mating or underestimating an item’s value, and poorly jury-rigging a
contraption so that it harms people (or at least the wrong people).

```

Nadar Mover through deep liquid
```

Perícias de Exploração
Skills from the exploration Perícia group are used to physically explore the
Ambiente around the characters, and to overcome physical obstacles.

Rewards for tests made with Perícias de Exploração typically include helping
another criatura engaging in the same task succeed without needing
to also Fazer um Teste, automatically succeeding on a follow-up Teste while
engaged in the same task, reaching a destination faster than anticipated,
and learning about or avoiding an upcoming Perigo.

Consequences for tests made with Perícias de Exploração include harming
yourself, your Equipamento, or your aliados; becoming lost; or stumbling headlong
into a Perigo or a place you were trying to avoid.

Perícias Interpessoais
Skills from the interpersonal Perícia group are used to socially interact
with other criaturas, and are particularly useful during negotiations
(see Chapter 11). Aside from the Trato Animal Perícia, you can
generally only use Perícias Interpessoais when you attempt to influence
criaturas who have emotions and who can understand you.

Rewards for tests made with Perícias Interpessoais typically include
gaining an extra favor, item, or piece of information from the people or
criaturas you interact with.

Consequences for tests made with Perícias Interpessoais include making
the criatura you’re interacting with angry, sad, embarrassed, offended,
or otherwise upset or uncomfortable. This Músculo cause them to ignore
you, Tempestade off, spread Boatos about you, attack you, betray you,
blackmail you, or otherwise attempt to harm you.

```

```
Ler Pessoas Read the emotions and body idioma of other criaturas
```

Draw Steel

```
Perícias de Conhecimento
Skills from the lore Perícia group are used to research and Recolher specific
information. They are especially useful during rests and downtime.
```

```
Rewards for tests made with Perícias de Conhecimento typically include learning an
extra piece of useful information.
Consequences for tests made with Perícias de Conhecimento typically include learning
an incorrect piece of information that seems useful, but which actually
works against your interests or wastes time. (It’s fun to roleplay these
kinds of moments, so lean in!) Alternatively, the Diretor can make
Médium and hard tests with lore group skills for each Herói in secret,
then let the jogadores know the narrative outcome without revealing the
outcome of the Poder roll (see the Regra Opcional: Secret Reativa Tests
sidebar earlier in this chapter).
```

```
Perícias de Intriga
Skills from the intrigue Perícia group are used in tasks centered around
investigation, thievery, and spycraft.
Rewards for tests made with skills from this group typically include
helping another criatura engaging in the same task succeed without
needing to also Fazer um Teste, automatically succeeding on a follow-up
Teste while engaged in the same task, discovering helpful information
in addition to what you set out to learn, and performing an extra bit of
clandestine activity in addition to what you set out to do.
```

```
Consequences for tests made with Perícias de Intriga include getting caught
in the act or failing to notice a detail that places you in danger, such as
triggering a Armadilha or walking into an ambush.
```

```
For the Diretor: Make Your Own Skills
Directors should feel free to make their own skills that they
feel are relevant and useful to their campaigns and adventures.
For instance, the game doesn’t have a Brewing Perícia for brewing
ale or a Painting Perícia for making art because those aren’t tasks
that typically come up in a game about fighting Monstros and
saving the world. However, a Diretor could decide that their
campaign involves poisoned barrels of ale and large amounts
of counterfeit art, and that adding these dois new skills to the
game would make it more fun for the jogadores. The Diretor
simply needs to pick a group for these new skills—in this case,
crafting makes sense. They then let the jogadores know that they
can swap out qualquer crafting Perícia they have for these new skills.
```

Example Tests

In this scenario, a trio of adventurers want to scale the 40-foot-high
walls surrounding a castle known as the Star Chamber, hoping to
covertly obtain information about their inimigo, Lady Morgant.

**Diretor (Matt):** _The towering walls that surround the Star Chamber
stand before you, the single Ferro gate closed and locked, with a Pelotão of
armed guards outside._

**James (playing Korvo, a Sombra):** _Let’s Mover to the side of the Parede
opposite the gate and make our ascent there._

**Grace (playing Val, a Conduíta):** _Agreed._

**Diretor:** _Okay. It’ll be a Músculo Teste to get up to the top of the Parede._

The Diretor knows that the walls around the Star Chamber, the head-
quarters of the evil knights Lady Morgant leads, are smooth and hard
to Escalar, designed to Repelir invaders. The Teste’s difficulty is hard, but the
Diretor keeps that information a secret for now.

**Alyssa (playing Jorn, a Tático):** _Let me go first. I’ve got good Músculo and can
Jogar the others down a rope once I’m up there. And I’ve got the Escalar Perícia._

**Diretor:** _For sure. Okay, roll it up._

Alyssa rolls 2d10 and gets a 13. She then adds her Músculo score of 2 and
her +2 Bônus for having an applicable Perícia to the roll, for a total of 17.

**Alyssa:** _A 17! That’s Grau 3, baby!_

The Diretor checks the Dificuldade do Teste Outcomes table to confirm that
a Grau 3 outcome is a Sucesso on a Teste Difícil.

**Diretor:** _Okay, you’re on top of the Parede. You notice a few guards
patrolling atop the opposite side of the Parede in the Distância, but they’re
looking out at the city right now._

**Alyssa:** _Great! I Lançamento down a rope. Val, you’re next._

**Grace:** _So it’s a Músculo Teste. Would you let me use Resiliência? It’s a lot of
physical exertion to Escalar._

**Diretor:** _It’s not a Escalar that would take you hours, so I don’t think
Resiliência applies here. But hey, the rope does make this an easier Teste._

**Grace:** _Fair. Okay, dice. Let’s do this._

Given the rope, the Diretor decides that this second Escalar attempt is
an Teste Fácil. Grace rolls 2d10 and gets an 11. With her Músculo score of 2,
that’s a 13.

**Grace:** _13! That’s a Grau 2 outcome for Val._

The Diretor checks the Dificuldade do Teste Outcomes table once more,
confirming that a Grau 2 outcome is a Sucesso on an Teste Fácil.

**Diretor:** _Good news! You make it to the top of the Parede alongside Jorn._

**James:** _Ah, crap. I have a Músculo of −1 and no skills to use. Unless I can
Intimidar the rope into lifting me up?_

**Diretor:** _Wishful thinking._

**Alyssa:** _What if Korvo grabs onto the rope and I Levantar him up while he just
hangs on for the Montar?_

**Diretor:** _Sure. That’ll be a Músculo Teste if Korvo’s down for it._

**James:** _Nothing risked, nothing saved. Let’s do it. Just be careful. qualquer loud
noises could attract those guards._

```
Alyssa: Please. I’m a pro. Since I’m lifting this polder off the Chão, does
the Levantar Perícia apply?
```

```
Diretor: Yes, it does. Roll it up. That’s a Médium difficulty Teste.
Lifting the diminutive polder, Alyssa rolls 2d10—but gets a 2! With her
Músculo score and Levantar Perícia Bônus of +2, the total is 6.
```

```
Alyssa: A 6! Oof. That’s Grau 1.
Diretor: Which is a Falha, but with no consequence. You realize you
just can’t Levantar Korvo off the Chão without making a lot of noise.
```

```
The Diretor then decides to make the Falha potentially more
interesting, by allowing the jogadores to decide if they want a Falha
without consequence or a Sucesso com Consequência.
Diretor: I’ll give you a choice, though. You can leave Korvo on the
Chão, or Puxar him up and suffer the consequence of making some noise
while doing so.
```

```
Grace: Ah, Puxar the polder up.
Alyssa: Yeah. We have to face these guards sometime.
```

```
James: Thanks for not leaving me behind!
Diretor: As Jorn yanks Korvo off the Chão and pulls him up to the top
of the Parede, a Guarda turns a bullseye lantern your way, calling out, “Who
goes there?”

Auxiliar um Teste
You can attempt to assist another criatura with a Teste they make,
provided you have a Perícia that applies to the Teste, the other criatura
isn’t using that same Perícia on the Teste, and you can describe how your
personagem helps to the Diretor’s satisfaction. In other words, your
attempt to help has to make sense, and you have to bring some useful
expertise to the table. Helping another criatura Furtivo by shouting
encouragement at them isn’t going to make them stealthier.
```

```
When you attempt to assist another criatura, Fazer um Teste using the Perícia
you choose, and using a characteristic chosen by the Diretor based on
the activity you use to help. The outcome of that Teste determines the
Bônus applied to the Teste you’re assisting:
```

```
á You get in the way or make things worse. The criatura takes a
Desvantagem on their Teste.
é Your help grants the other criatura an Vantagem on their Teste.
í Your help gives the other criatura a double Vantagem on their Teste.
For example, when an aliado tries to pick a jailer’s pocket, you Músculo
attempt to assist by using the Flertar Perícia to distract the jailer. The
Diretor accepts this, and asks you to make a Presença Teste using Flertar.
The outcome of that Teste determines the Bônus you provide to the
other Herói’s Agilidade Teste to pick the jailer’s pocket—or whether you
fumble the distraction and potentially draw attention to the attempt.
```

Esconder-se and Furtivo

```
Hiding and sneaking are important tools for heroes and their foes. You
Músculo want to avoid another criatura’s notice to Bisbilhotar on conver-
sations, steal items, set up an ambush, or avoid a Combate Encontro.
```

```
Hiding
To Esconder-se from a criatura, you must have Cobertura or Encobrimento from that
criatura (see Chapter 10: Combate), who can’t observe you attempting
to Esconder-se. A criatura is observing you if they’re aware of your specific
location before you attempt to Esconder-se. This means they can pinpoint you
with their senses and point a finger (or paw or Tentáculo) at you as if to
shout, “There they are!” If you duck behind a barrel to Esconder-se from a foe,
your attempt to Esconder-se has a chance of succeeding only if your foe doesn’t
notice you doing so. If you’re being chased by a hungry Dragão, you can
Esconder-se only if you first Mover to a location where the Dragão can’t observe
you—for instance, by turning a sharp corner into a tunnel full of Gigante
stalagmites before the Dragão does. You then make your Esconder-se attempt.
```

```
When you use the Esconder-se Manobra to Esconder-se during Combate while you
have Cobertura or Encobrimento from a criatura who isn’t observing you,
you are automatically Escondida from them unless the Diretor deems
otherwise. If you Esconder-se fora de Combate, the Diretor Músculo ask you to
Fazer um Teste using the Esconder-se Perícia to determine how well Escondida you are.
While you are Escondida from another criatura, the criatura can’t alvo
you with abilities that don’t have the Área Palavra-Chave. This Benefício ends
as soon as you are no longer Escondida from that criatura.
```

```
Additionally, while you are Escondida from another criatura, you gain an
Vantagem on Habilidade rolls made against that criatura. This Benefício lasts until
the end of the Turno in which you are no longer Escondida. This means you
can be Escondida from another criatura no começo of your Turno, Mover out
of Cobertura or Encobrimento toward them and use an Habilidade against them,
and still gain an Vantagem on Habilidade rolls made against the criatura as long
as you use the Habilidade before the end of that Turno.
```

```
Tests
```

You are no longer Escondida from a criatura if you don’t have Cobertura or
Encobrimento from them. If you use an Habilidade, interact with an inimigo,
Mover without sneaking, or otherwise make noise or reveal yourself
while Escondida, you are no longer Escondida once the activity that reveals
you resolves. For instance, if you are Escondida and then make a Golpe, you
resolve the Golpe first, then are no longer Escondida.

Searching for Escondida criaturas
You can Procurar for criaturas who are Escondida from you as long as those
criaturas are within 10 squares and you have Linha of Efeito to them. To
do so, you use a Manobra to make an Intuição Teste using the Procurar
Perícia, and qualquer Escondida criaturas within 10 squares of you each make
an opposed Agilidade Teste using the Esconder-se Perícia (see Opposed Poder Rolls
earlier in this chapter). At the Diretor’s discretion, different charac-
teristics and skills can be used in this opposed Teste. For example, your
foe Músculo make a Presença Teste using the Trato Animal Perícia to Esconder-se
among a flock of sheep without disturbing them, or you could make
a Razão Teste using the Bisbilhotar Perícia to pick out the breathing of a
criatura Escondida in the dark.

If the total of your Teste is higher than that of a Escondida criatura, they are
no longer Escondida from you. Otherwise, they remain Escondida from you.
As part of the Manobra used to Procurar Criaturas Escondidas, you can
point out qualquer criaturas you notice to aliados within 10 squares of you,
making those criaturas no longer Escondida from those aliados.

If a criatura is Escondida from your aliados but not from you, you can
use a Manobra without making a Teste to point that criatura out to
your aliados.

```
Sneaking
While you are Escondida from another criatura and not durante o Combate, you
can attempt to Furtivo—avoiding the senses of other criaturas as you
Mover around them in the Receptivo—to remain Escondida. While sneaking,
your Velocidade is halved. To Furtivo, you make an Agilidade Teste using the Furtivo
Perícia with a difficulty set by the Diretor. If you succeed, you remain
Escondida during your Movimento. This Teste can use another characteristic
at the Diretor’s discretion, such as using Presença to blend in with a
crowd on a packed city street.
```

```
What Does It Mean to Be Observed?
Most of the time, if a criatura has Linha of Efeito to you, they’re
able to observe you—especially if you’re an active threat to
them, such as in a Combate Encontro. However, the game leaves
what it means to be observed Receptivo to interpretation, because
there are circumstances where a criatura Músculo have Linha of
Efeito to you but isn’t observing you, giving you a chance to
Esconder-se. For example, a Guarda in a crowded marketplace likely
isn’t able to observe every criatura within their Linha of Efeito, so
slipping away to Esconder-se in that situation is probably easier than
hiding from them in an otherwise empty street. The Diretor
has the final say on who is observing you, and who you are
able to observe.
```

Draw Steel

```
Group Tests
Whenever dois or more heroes attempt to overcome a single, simple
task together that calls for them to make the same Teste, the Diretor
can call for a Teste de Grupo. For example, if several heroes are all attempting
to Escalar the outside of a tower at the same time, giving each other
assistance and advice, they could be asked to make a Músculo Teste de Grupo.
If a group of heroes attempt to Furtivo by a sleeping Ogro, they Músculo
make an Agilidade Teste de Grupo.
```

**Teste de Grupo Difficulty**

```
The Diretor determines the difficulty of a Teste de Grupo the same way
they do for individual tests. Group tests can be easy, Médium, or hard.
```

```
Making a Teste de Grupo
Each Herói participating in the Teste de Grupo makes the Teste individually
as usual, but the Diretor waits until all the tests have been made to
interpret the outcome. A Herói who is participating in the Teste de Grupo
can’t assist another Herói participating in the Teste.
```

```
Teste de Grupo Outcome
When interpreting the outcome of a Teste de Grupo, the Diretor first
determines if the task succeeded or not before figuring out rewards
and consequences. If half or more of the heroes making the Teste de Grupo
succeed, then the Teste de Grupo succeeds. Otherwise, the Teste de Grupo fails.
```

```
If the heroes succeeded and half or more of them obtained a Recompensa
from the Teste, the Diretor gives the group a collective Recompensa and
ignores qualquer consequences incurred in the Teste. This collective Recompensa
should be equivalent to earning dois individual rewards. In fact, it could
be dois Consumível items, juicy pieces of information, or Herói tokens.
However, it could also be something more tailored to the task. For
instance, if the heroes earn a collective Recompensa while sneaking through
the camp of an inimigo army, the Diretor Músculo allow them to Sabotar
a bunch of Guerra engines or steal a few horses on their way out.
If the heroes failed the Teste de Grupo and more than half of them incurred
a consequence as a result, the Diretor gives the group a collective
consequence and ignores qualquer earned rewards. This collective
consequence should affect everyone. An easy option is for the stress of
failing the Teste to cause each Herói to take a Desvantagem on their next Poder
roll, or for the Diretor to gain 2 Malícia per Herói no começo of the
next Combate Encontro. But the consequence could also be tailored
to the task. For instance, if the heroes fail in their attempt to Furtivo
through the camp of an inimigo army, they’re spotted and the camp
immediately goes on alert as waves of inimigos attack them.
```

```
If fewer than half the heroes incur a consequence or earn a Recompensa on
their individual tests, then the Teste de Grupo simply succeeds or fails.
```

```
Tests
```

Montage Tests

When a group of heroes works together over time to accomplish
a common goal that requires more than a single characteristic, the
Diretor can call for a Teste de Montagem. Such tests typically take place
over a prolonged period and Foco on collective or shared activities.
Navigating a vast desert, convincing farmers to rise up against a
tyrannical Líder, and performing a ritual to Receptivo a magically sealed
gate can all be accomplished with montage tests.

In a Teste de Montagem, the jogadores take turns making tests as their
characters Ombrada a task together in a Teste de Montagem Ronda. Each Herói has
a chance to Fazer um Teste (or to assist another Herói’s Teste; see Auxiliar um Teste
above) intended to influence the outcome of the task.

A Herói can also Gastar their Turno using an item, Habilidade, or other
option they have available that they believe can help in the montage
Teste. For example, if a group of heroes want to cross an ocean on a
sailing ship before a Tempestade begins, um Herói Músculo make use of a
Magia fan that creates wind to keep the sails full day and night. The
Diretor decides that this clever action gives the heroes 2 automatic
successes in the Teste de Montagem, with no individual tests necessary (see
Total Successes and Failures below).

Once a Herói makes a Teste, assists with a Teste, or uses an Habilidade or
other option, they can’t do anything else as part of the Teste de Montagem
until each other Herói involved in the Teste de Montagem does so as well. A
Herói can also choose to do nothing, most often if they have no um to
assist and fear that their actions Músculo make the situation worse (see
Teste de Montagem Outcomes below). Once every Herói has had a chance to
act, the Teste de Montagem Ronda ends and a new um begins.

**Time and Stakes**

As the name suggests, montage tests create a kind of cinematic
montage in the action of the game. A Teste de Montagem can take place over
the course of several hours or days, with each individual Teste or other
activity set up as a brief vignette within the montage that stars um of
the heroes. Combate encounters, negotiations, and other challenges and
scenes can break up a Teste de Montagem (see Sample Teste de Montagem below).

The Diretor should deploy montage tests only when the jogadores are
engaged in overcoming a goal that has stakes for the story and some
sort of pressure, such as a looming deadline or impending harm. A
Teste de Montagem is great for a race to get to another location before an
inimigo army does, a chase to escape or catch up to a foe, weathering
a Perigo, preparing a village for Guerra, or similar activities. Low- or
no-stakes activities such as travel through a forest with no time
pressure, or training during a Descanso to use a new kit, can be narrated in
montage style, but they don’t require a Teste de Montagem.

**Diretor Sets the Scene**

no começo of a Teste de Montagem, the Diretor should describe the scenario
underlying the task at hand, and the various challenges the heroes
Músculo face as they attempt to collectively accomplish it. For example, if
the heroes are chasing down a pickpocket through a crowded market,
the Diretor Músculo talk about the throngs of innocent people Posicionamento de Palco
the way forward, obscuring the characters’ Visão, and making noise
that complicates attempts to hear the thief ’s Ligeiro footsteps. There
are also traveling carts to dodge, the Velocidade and dexterity of the pursued
personagem to contend with, and a Bando of stray dogs who chase after
anyone who sprints through the market. Describing these obstacles
gives the heroes ideas about what they’re trying to overcome as they
attempt to achieve their goals.

```
Individual Tests in Montage Tests
The difficulty of each individual Teste in a Teste de Montagem is set by the
Diretor and can vary from Teste to Teste. For instance, if the heroes are
preparing the defenses of a village threatened by a band of approaching
raiders, the Diretor Músculo decide that a personagem who wants to Cavar a
trench around the village needs to make an easy Músculo Teste. Another
Herói wants to train the untested farmers of the village in the ways of
Guerra, and the Diretor decides this is a hard Razão Teste.
```

```
The same rules and guidelines that apply to all individual tests apply
in montage tests. If a Herói has a clever, out-of-the-box idea that the
Diretor thinks should automatically succeed without rolling dice, it
does. If the circumstances of the Teste should grant an Vantagem or a Desvantagem,
they do. Individual Teste outcomes shouldn’t halt the story.
The Diretor should couch each Sucesso or Falha as it relates to the
overall goal of the Teste de Montagem. If the heroes are trying to Alcance an
ancient temple, failing a Músculo Teste to ford a river in their path doesn’t
mean they don’t cross the river and are stuck on the other side. But it
could mean that failing to cross the river in a timely manner gives a
Rival group of villains the chance to beat the party to the temple.
```

```
The rewards and consequences of individual tests made during a
Teste de Montagem are handled on an individual basis. The Diretor can use
the default of gaining additional Malícia in the next Combate Encontro
for consequences and having the party gain Herói tokens for rewards to
keep the montage moving.
```

```
Can’t Use the Same Perícia Twice
An individual personagem can’t use the same Perícia more than once in a
Teste de Montagem. Though multiple heroes can use the same Perícia, a Teste or
an assist with a specific Perícia represents each characters’ entire contri-
bution to the Teste de Montagem with that Perícia. At the Diretor’s discretion,
this restriction can be lifted for prolonged montage tests, or for montage
tests that are limited in scope and have only a small number of skills
that apply to them.
```

**New Challenges for Each Teste**

```
In general, when a Herói makes a Teste as part of a Teste de Montagem, they
should choose new obstacles to overcome that haven’t already been
overcome as part of the Teste. If the heroes are chasing a thief through
the marketplace and um of them has already Distraído the Bando of
stray dogs with a deft hand and a piece of meat, additional tests made to
distract the animals don’t count toward the outcome of the Teste de Montagem.
When it fits the scenario, the Diretor can adjust this restriction. If part
of a Teste de Montagem involves searching for people trapped in a Queimando
building, the Diretor is likely to allow multiple tests to fight or avoid the
Fogo, since this will happen throughout the Teste de Montagem, not just once.
```

```
Introducing More Challenges
During a Teste de Montagem, a Diretor can introduce new challenges for
the heroes to face. While attempting to run out of a Queimando building
from the top floor, the characters Músculo discover that by the time they
Alcance the second floor, beams are starting to fall and glass windows are
exploding as the structure starts to collapse. These new challenges can
be incorporated into the tests the heroes subsequently make.

Sucesso Total

without Complicação. For instance, if the heroes engaged in a montage
Teste to cross a desert and Alcance a city before a tyrant’s army arrives there
and levels the place, a Sucesso Total sees them arrive at the city gates
with plenty of time to warn people of the impending assault.
The heroes earn 1 Vitória when they achieve Sucesso Total on an easy
or moderate Teste de Montagem, and 2 Victories on a hard Teste de Montagem.
```

```
Sucesso Parcial
If the heroes earn a Sucesso Parcial, they succeed at what they set out
to do, but there is a Complicação or a cost involved. For instance, when
crossing the desert to Alcance and warn the city of the tyrant’s army,
a mixed Sucesso sees the characters arrive at the city gates with the
inimigo forces just behind them. Alternatively, the Diretor Músculo allow
the heroes to arrive well before the army, but they don’t Cobertura their
movements well enough. The tyrant realizes the city has been warned
and decides to call in a favor to have a powerful Dragão join the siege.
```

```
The heroes earn 1 Vitória when they achieve Sucesso Parcial on a hard
or moderate Teste de Montagem.
```

```
Falha Total
If the heroes suffer Falha Total, they don’t achieve what they set out
to do. Just as with standard tests, Falha on a Teste de Grupo shouldn’t bring
a story to a halt. Falha Total should make things more interesting and
challenging! With a Falha Total in a Teste de Montagem to cross the desert
and warn the city, the characters arrive at the city to find it already
under siege by the tyrant.
```

```
Sample Teste de Montagem
Four heroes must cross the vast and inhospitable Deserto Infinito
to warn the city of Ahset that the tyrannical Empress Vardo is
coming to conquer them. If the characters arrive in time, they can
organize the defenses of the city, giving its people a greater chance of
defeating the tyrant.
```

```
The Diretor determines that crossing the desert is a Teste de Montagem of
hard difficulty. With four heroes involved, the Limite de Sucesso is 6 and the
Limite de Falha is 2 as the Teste de Montagem begins.
```

```
Teste de Montagem Ronda 1
When the Teste begins, the Diretor sets the scene. They tell the jogadores
that the desert has extreme temperatures, sudden sandstorms, high
dunes to cross, deep sand, chasms, and Areia Movediça lakes. The Diretor
decides that the challenges of dunes, deep sand, and Areia Movediça can be
tackled multiple times in the Teste, since the Deserto Infinito is filled with
these hazards.
Urdoncara, a Fúria, starts things off by asking to make an Intuição Teste
using the Natureza Perícia to predict the best times of day to travel and
rest. She wants the party to avoid the worst of the desert’s extreme
temperatures and qualquer sandstorms or other weather phenomena, so
that the journey is quickened. The Diretor decides this is an Teste Fácil.
Urdoncara makes the Teste and gets a total of 12, earning 1 Sucesso for
the Teste de Montagem.
```

```
Jorn, a Tático, wants to make a Razão Teste using the Escalar Perícia to
Liderar the party over dunes and other hazards with minimal effort. The
Diretor allows the attempt, but says that knowing what makes um
dune easier to Escalar than another is tricky, setting the difficulty at
hard. Jorn gets a 9 on the Teste and fails with a consequence, which the
Diretor decides will cause him to take a Desvantagem on his next Poder roll
due to the exertion. The Teste de Montagem has 1 Sucesso and 1 Falha.
```

```
Total Successes and Failures
The Diretor or another jogador will Rastrear the total number of successes
and failures the heroes earn during a Teste de Montagem. Every Teste de Montagem
has a Limite de Sucesso and a Limite de Falha. When the number of successful
tests equals the Limite de Sucesso, the Teste de Montagem ends and the heroes
achieve Sucesso Total (seeMontage Teste Outcomes below). The montage
Teste can also end when the number of failed tests equals the Falha
limit, and the heroes suffer Falha Total.
```

**Limited Rounds**

```
A Teste de Montagem should last only 2 Teste de Montagem rounds. If the heroes
don’t end the Teste de Montagem by achieving the Limite de Sucesso or Falha
limit, the Teste de Montagem ends when the second Teste de Montagem Ronda is
over. This time limit helps to keep a Teste de Montagem from becoming a
slog, and prevents heroes from simply using their turns to assist the
um Herói with the best chance of Sucesso. This can inspire each Herói to
be a more active participant in the Teste de Montagem. That said, the Diretor
can increase the number of rounds a Teste de Montagem lasts if they wish to
create a particularly grueling Desafio.
```

```
Teste de Montagem Difficulty
The Diretor determines the Limite de Sucesso and Limite de Falha of a montage
Teste. They can share this information or keep it secret, depending on
what feels the most fun and dramatic for the situation and the jogadores.
```

```
In general, the higher the Limite de Sucesso, the harder and more
complicated it is for the heroes to overcome the Teste de Montagem, since a
Herói can’t make the same Teste twice. The Teste de Montagem Difficulty table
gives a recommended Limite de Sucesso and Limite de Falha for easy, moderate,
and hard montage tests for groups with five heroes.
```

```
Teste de Montagem Difficulty
Difficulty Limite de Sucesso Limite de Falha
Easy 5 5
Moderate 6 4
Hard 7 3
```

```
For larger or smaller groups, the Diretor can make the following
adjustments to keep montage tests achievable but challenging:
```

```
¥ For four or fewer heroes, decrease the Limite de Sucesso and Falha limits
by 1 (to a minimum of 2) for every Herói fewer than five. For example,
if a group has only três heroes, an easy Teste de Montagem has a Sucesso
limit and Limite de Falha of 3.
¥ For six or more heroes, increase the Sucesso and Falha limits by 1 for
every Herói more than five.
```

```
Teste de Montagem Outcomes
A Teste de Montagem can have três different outcomes:
```

```
¥ If the heroes hit the Limite de Sucesso before hitting the Limite de Falha or
before the time runs out for the Teste, they achieve Sucesso Total.
¥ If the heroes hit the Limite de Falha or time runs out, and if they’ve
achieved at least dois more successes than failures, they achieve a
Sucesso Parcial.
¥ If the heroes hit the Limite de Falha or time runs out, and if they
don’t have at least dois more successes than failures, they suffer
Falha Total.
```

```
Tests
```

Karrel, an Elementalista, thinks the group Músculo cross the desert faster
if they have specially modified sandshoes that distribute their weight
and prevent their feet from sinking into the sand. The Diretor loves the
idea, and decides that making four pairs of the shoes while traveling the
desert is a Médium Razão Teste. Karrel gets to use their Alfaiataria Perícia
and winds up with a total of 13—a Sucesso com Consequência. The
Diretor decides to gain an additional 2 Malícia no começo of the next
Combate Encontro as a consequence, but the group now has 2 successes
and 1 Falha on the Teste de Montagem.

Val, a Conduíta, offers to Batedor ahead for the group with an Intuição
Teste, using the Navegação Perícia to find the best path forward and avoid
hazards such as chasms and Areia Movediça. The Diretor thinks that acting
as Vigia in a vast desert is an easy task. Val smashes it with a 21—a
Sucesso with a Recompensa—and the Diretor decides to get Criativa. Val’s
Vigia skills grant the next Herói to act in the Teste de Montagem an Vantagem on
their Teste. At the end of the first Teste de Montagem Ronda, the heroes have 3
successes and 1 Falha.

Interlude
Before the next Teste de Montagem Ronda, the Diretor pauses the montage
Teste to run a battle with a Minhoca das Fendas Real, who attacks the heroes as
they cross over an ancient ruin partially buried in the sand. After the
heroes defeat the Minhoca das Fendas Real, the Teste continues.

Teste de Montagem Ronda 2
Urdoncara wants to make a Músculo Teste using the Levantar Perícia to carry most
of the group’s Equipamento as they cross the desert, allowing her aliados
to Mover more quickly while she keeps up with her superior fortitude.
The Diretor thinks this arduous task has a hard difficulty. Urdoncara
gets a 17 on the Teste thanks to the Vantagem from Val’s earlier Sucesso. The
Teste de Montagem has 4 successes and 1 Falha.

Jorn, eager to prove himself after his last Falha, asks to make a Músculo
Teste using the Liderar Perícia, representing tying a rope around his waist to
drag his weaker friends over the tallest dunes. The Diretor likes the
idea but doesn’t think the Liderar Perícia applies to the task. They tell Jorn
that Levantar is more appropriate, since the Tático is using his physical
Perícia to aid his friends and not really doing anything interpersonal. Jorn
agrees, and the Diretor sets the Teste at Médium difficulty. Making
the Teste with a Desvantagem because of his previous Falha, the Tático rolls
a 15, which is a Sucesso com Consequência. The Teste de Montagem has 5
successes and 1 Falha, but the consequence gives the Diretor another
2 Malícia no começo of the next Combate Encontro.

Since the group needs only um more Sucesso to achieve Sucesso Total,
Karrel says she’d like to assist Val in whatever task she decides to take
on. Val wants to Recolher lore about the Khem-hor—the inhabitants of
the Deserto Infinito—to remember their time-honored travel techniques
using the História Perícia. Karrel has the Cultura Perícia, which she can use
to assist by providing information about the lives and Sociedade of the
Khem-hor. She makes a Razão Teste to assist and gets a 16, granting Val
an Vantagem on her upcoming Teste.

Val attempts to Recolher lore about the Khem-hor, wanting to know if she
can remember qualquer of their travel from her studies of the História of the
region. The Diretor has her make a hard Razão Teste with an Vantagem,
thanks to Karrel’s input on the current state of Khem-hor Cultura. Val
gets a 17, and the Diretor decides that the Conduíta recalls a shortcut
through a canyon tunnel that leads directly to Ahset, avoiding a vast
lake of Areia Movediça. The heroes get their sixth Sucesso in the montage
Teste, achieving Sucesso Total, and earn 2 Victories.

```
Other Options
The heroes could have attempted other tests during their travels,
such as an Agilidade Teste using the Furtivo Perícia to Liderar the group through
dangerous shortcuts in the desert without being seen or waylaid by
predators, a Razão Teste using the Natureza Perícia to find enough food and
Água to keep the group hydrated and fed, or a Presença Teste using the
Música Perícia to inspire aliados to travel faster with song.
```

```
Combate
```

```
Chapter 10
```

```
Sides
Every Combate Encontro is a conflict between dois sides. The heroes
and qualquer of their aliados are um side, controlled by the jogadores. qualquer
criaturas who oppose the heroes are the other side, controlled by
the Diretor. All criaturas who oppose the heroes are on the same
side, even if those criaturas also oppose each other. For example, if
the heroes are battling a group of bandits when a Minhoca das Fendas Real
suddenly bursts into the fray to devour jogador characters and brigands
alike, the Minhoca is still on the side of the bandits for the purpose of the
game’s Combate rules.
```

```
Combate Ronda
Combate takes place over a series of Combate rounds. During a Combate
Ronda, each criatura in the battle takes a Turno. Once every criatura has
taken a Turno, a new Ronda begins.
```

**When Does Combate Start?**

```
Combate starts as soon as um criatura intends to harm another, or
when some environmental Efeito is in a position to deal dano to or
impose other negative effects on um or more criaturas. This means
that even before the action happens, a Herói can’t use a heroic Habilidade
without spending their Recurso Heróico on it, because Combate has
already begun!
```

# **Combate**

```
hen the heroes face a problem that can be solved only with
action, or when they come up against criaturas who want to
harm them, it’s time to Jogar down!
```

Set the Map

When Combate begins, the Diretor should position miniatures or
tokens on a gridded map to represent the Ambiente, the heroes,
their foes, and qualquer other criaturas in the battle.

**Tamanho and Space**

A criatura’s Tamanho indicates how many squares they occupy during
Combate, which defines the criatura’s space. If a criatura’s Tamanho is 1, they
occupy a space of 1 Quadrado. If a criatura is larger than 1 Quadrado, their
Tamanho equals the number of squares they take up in length, width, and
height. For example, a cavalo has a Tamanho of 2, which means that during
Combate, they occupy a space that is 2 squares long, 2 squares wide, and
2 squares high. You could also think of that space as a Cubo that is 2
squares on all sides.

The minimum amount of space a criatura can take up during Combate is
1 Quadrado, but Tamanho 1 criaturas can run the Alcance from tiny pixies to small
polders, Médium humans, and large Hakaan. As such, for criaturas of
Tamanho 1, that Tamanho is further broken down as 1PP, 1P, 1M, or 1G—abbrevia-
tions for tiny, small, Médium, and large. Tamanho 1PP is um Tamanho smaller than
Tamanho 1P, dois sizes smaller than 1M, três sizes smaller than 1G, and four
sizes smaller than Tamanho 2. If a mechanic mentions Tamanho 1 criaturas, that
mechanic applies to all criaturas of Tamanho 1.

objetos also have a Tamanho rating, which usually indicates how many
squares they occupy. Some objetos are identified as having an irregular
Tamanho, with that Tamanho instead representing the objeto’s mass and weight
relative to a criatura of the same Tamanho. If a mechanic mentions objetos of
a certain Tamanho, that mechanic includes all objetos of that Tamanho, including
irregular objetos.

The criatura Sizes table shows example sizes for criaturas up to Tamanho
5, but larger sizes are possible. There is no limit to what a criatura’s
Tamanho Músculo be.

```
NPC aliados
If an NPC aliado fights alongside the heroes, the Diretor should
give the jogadores the aliado’s Ficha de Criatura and let them control
the NPC during Combate. The Diretor has enough to worry
about. As well, qualquer missteps, mistakes, or triumphs the aliado
makes will be thanks to the decisions of the jogadores and not
the Diretor, which can make the outcome of the battle more
satisfying for the jogadores.
```

```
criatura Sizes
Tamanho Example criatura
1PP Pixie
1P Polder
1M Humano
1G Hakaan
2 Ogro
3 Arbusto Cambaleante
4 Gigante da Colina
5 Dragão de Agouro
How Big is a Quadrado?
It’s helpful to know how big a Quadrado is for abilities and features
that heroes and NPCs can use fora de Combate. By default,
a Quadrado is 5 feet on all sides. But the Diretor can change
this measurement to 2 yards, 2 meters, 1 meter, or qualquer other
measurement you prefer, as long as that scale stays consistent
throughout your game.
```

Draw Steel

```
Determine Surprise
When battle starts, the Diretor determines which criaturas, if qualquer, are
caught off Guarda. qualquer criatura who isn’t ready for Combate no começo
of an Encontro is Surpreso until the end of the first Combate Ronda. A
Surpreso criatura can’t take triggered actions or free triggered actions,
and Habilidade rolls made against them gain an Vantagem.
```

```
For example, if the heroes Furtivo up unnoticed on a camp of marauders
and attack, each Saqueador is Surpreso. Likewise, if the heroes fail to
notice that all the cloaked figures in a tavern are actually brain-de-
vouring zombies, then the heroes are Surpreso. If um of the heroes
notices the disguised Morto-Vivo before the zombies attack but has no
opportunity to warn their aliados, that Herói isn’t Surpreso but the rest of
the characters are.
```

```
Determine Who Goes First
Sometimes figuring out who gets to take the first Turno durante o Combate is
automatic. If all the criaturas on um side are Surpreso, then a criatura
on the other side gets to act first. But if both sides have criaturas who
aren’t Surpreso, the Diretor or a jogador they choose rolls a d10. On a 6
or higher, the jogadores determine who goes first—the heroes’ side or the
other side. Otherwise, the Diretor decides which side goes first.
```

```
criaturas Take Turns
Whichever side goes first chooses a criatura (or sometimes a group of
criaturas on the Diretor’s side) to act no começo of Combate. Whenever
the rules talk about a criatura acting durante o Combate, that criatura gets
to take their Turno. When that Turno is over, the other side chooses a
criatura to act. Play continues back and forth this way as each criatura
takes their Turno.
```

```
Unless an Habilidade or Especial rule allows them to do so, qualquer criatura who
has taken a Turno during a Combate Ronda can’t act De Novo until a new
Ronda begins. To help Rastrear which criaturas have already acted in the
current Ronda, each criatura can have a coin, token, or card they flip
over on the table, or some kind of flag they set on their virtual tabletop
token, once they’ve taken a Turno. That way, all the jogadores know who
has already acted and who hasn’t.
In many encounters, a point comes when um side has criaturas who
haven’t acted yet but all the criaturas on the other side have. The
criaturas who have yet to act get to take their turns in qualquer Ordem they
choose, without turns in between from the other side. For example,
consider four heroes taking on six inimigos. When all four heroes
have taken their turns and four of the inimigos have taken theirs,
the dois inimigos who are left take their turns um after the other to
end the Ronda.
```

```
Determining Who Acts Next
When it comes to the heroes’ side, the choice of who should act next is
intended to give jogadores the opportunity to comment, strategize, and
plan. Some tables, in some encounters, Músculo find that the choice of
who should act next isn’t obvious, Conduzindo to debate. That’s fine. Delib-
erating about what the group should do next is classic roleplaying.
```

```
In general, though, most groups find that it’s usually only um or dois
jogadores in a given Ronda who think it best if they act next. And as soon
as those jogadores explain why they want to act next and what they plan
on doing, the issue is quickly resolved.
```

```
Argumento Timer
If the jogadores do end up arguing in circles about what to do next, the
Diretor can place a timer on the discussion. Usually, giving the jogadores
a warning and 30 seconds to decide who goes next does the trick.
If they can’t choose by the end of that time, the Diretor chooses a
Herói to act.
```

```
Alternative Turno Ordem
If planning everyone’s Turno Ordem isn’t fun for your group, you
can leave it to the dice instead. no começo of Combate, have
each Herói, inimigo, and group of inimigos make an Agilidade Teste,
then record the totals. When it’s time for someone on the
heroes’ side to act, the Herói with the highest total goes first.
On the next Herói Turno, the Herói with the second-highest total
takes their Turno, and so on. The Diretor-controlled criaturas
act the same way. criaturas on the same side should reroll tied
Agilidade tests to determine who among the tied criaturas acts
before the others.
At the Diretor’s discretion, a Herói can swap their Turno in the
Ordem with another willing Herói no começo of a new Combate
Ronda. This allows certain abilities that interact with the
core Turno Ordem system, such as the Sombra’s Hesitation Is
Weakness Habilidade, to better work with this alternative system.
```

```
Combate
```

inimigos Act In Groups
Diretor-controlled criaturas act in groups, with information for
building groups found in _Draw Steel: Monsters_. When a group of
inimigos acts, the Diretor chooses a single criatura or Lacaio Esquadrão
to take a Turno. Once that Turno is over, the Diretor chooses another
criatura in that group to take a Turno, continuing until all members of
the group have taken their Turno.

**End of Ronda**

Once all criaturas on both sides of a battle have acted, the Combate
Ronda ends and a new Combate Ronda begins. The side whose
members acted first during the initial Combate Ronda goes first in all
subsequent rounds.

Agindo em seu Turno

Each criatura durante o Combate—whether Herói, adversary, or something in
between—gets to take a **Ação Principal** , a **Manobra** , and a **Ação de Movimento**
on their Turno (explained later in this chapter). Each combatant can
perform their Manobra and Ação Principal in qualquer Ordem, and can break up
the Movimento granted by their Ação de Movimento before, after, or between
their Manobra and Ação Principal however they like. You can also Turno
your Ação Principal into a Ação de Movimento or a Manobra, so that your Turno
can alternatively consist of dois Mover actions and a Manobra, or dois
maneuvers and a Ação de Movimento.

The Movimento section below breaks down how your Ação de Movimento
works, while the Maneuvers and Main Actions sections break
down the baseline maneuvers and main actions your personagem can
undertake. For qualquer activities not specifically covered in those rules,
such as cutting down a chandelier to drop on inimigos, the Diretor
decides whether such an activity is a Manobra or a Ação Principal.

**Triggered Actions and Free Triggered**

**Actions**

Your Herói Músculo have um or more unique triggered actions, each of
which has a specified Gatilho that allows the action to be used. You
can use um Reação per Ronda, either on your Turno or another
criatura’s Turno, but only when the action’s Gatilho occurs. For instance,
a Fúria Herói can use the Linhas de Força Reação to force Mover a
alvo, but only after an inimigo has first tried to force Mover the Fúria or
another nearby criatura.

A Reação Livre follows the same rules as a Reação, but
it doesn’t count against your limit of um Reação per Ronda. For
instance, a Sombra Herói can use their Hesitar é Fraqueza Habilidade to
take their Turno in response to the Gatilho of another Herói ending their
Turno. But because that Habilidade is a Reação Livre, the Sombra can
still use their No Meio da Confusão Reação later in the Ronda.

If multiple triggered actions occur in response to the same Gatilho, qualquer
heroes and other jogador-controlled criaturas taking a Reação
or a Reação Livre decide among themselves which of those
triggered actions are resolved first. Then the Diretor decides the same
for criaturas they control.

qualquer Efeito that prevents you from using triggered actions also prevents
you from using free triggered actions.

```
Free Maneuvers
Boring stuff like opening an unlocked door, picking up an arrow from the
Chão, giving an objeto to an Adjacente aliado, or drawing a Arma doesn’t
require a Manobra or a Ação Principal. Rather, you can undertake such
straightforward activities as free maneuvers on your Turno. A Manobra Livre
follows the same rules as a regular Manobra, but you can typically take as
many free maneuvers as you like.
```

```
At the Diretor’s discretion, circumstances could make something that is
typically boring more impactful and exciting. For instance, if you need to
pick a Magia arrow up off the Chão during a violent earthquake, what
would otherwise be a Manobra Livre could require a Manobra or a main
action to accomplish.
Likewise, the Natureza of an activity Músculo make it too complicated for a free
Manobra. For example, picking up the body of an Inconsciente Talento aliado
to carry them to safety can probably be done as a Manobra Livre. But if
your Músculo is lacking and you need to pick up a Tático aliado decked out
in the Armadura Brilhante kit, the Diretor Músculo determine that you need to
use a regular Manobra to hoist their armored form over your shoulders.
```

```
qualquer Efeito that prevents you from using maneuvers also prevents you
from using free maneuvers.
```

```
No-Action Activities
Free maneuvers Cobertura most of the simple activities you Músculo want
to undertake on your Turno. When it isn’t your Turno, you can typically
undertake even simpler activities requiring no action with the Diretor’s
approval. For instance, shouting out a warning to an aliado or dropping an
item so another criatura can pick it up require no action.
```

```
The Diretor can limit what kinds of no-action activities you can attempt
when it isn’t your Turno. For instance, shouting out a warning about an
unseen foe to an aliado on the aliado’s or the foe’s Turno requires no action.
But the Diretor Músculo stop you from giving that aliado complex tactical
advice when it isn’t your Turno, saying that doing so instead requires a free
Manobra on your Turno.
```

```
Movimento
During Combate, criaturas can employ multiple Mecânica that allow
them to Mover around the battlefield. The most common of those
Mecânica is the Avançar or Retirar-se Ação de Movimento (detailed under
Mover Actions below), but abilities granted by your Classe, Equipamento,
Linhagem, Título, or other options Músculo allow you other ways to Mover.
```

```
Your Herói starts with a Velocidade granted by their Linhagem—usually 5. This
represents the maximum number of squares you can Mover when you
take the Ação de Movimento or when another Efeito allows you to Mover. Your
Velocidade can be increased by your kit and other game options.
All squares Adjacente to your personagem cost 1 Movimento to Mover into. No,
there’s no Pythagorean theorem on the grid. It’s a game, don’t overthink it.
```

```
Your Herói can Mover freely through an aliado’s space. You can Mover through
an inimigo’s space, but that space is Terreno Difícil (see below). You can’t
stop moving in qualquer other criatura’s space, including to make a Golpe or use
a Ação Principal or Manobra while in that space and then continuing your
Mover, unless that criatura’s Tamanho is dois or more sizes greater or smaller
than your own.
At the Diretor’s discretion, you can be forced into the same space as
another criatura whose Tamanho is within 1 of yours, such as by Caindo down
a narrow shaft with such a criatura already at the bottom. When you are
squeezed into the same space as another criatura whose Tamanho is within 1 of
yours, your Habilidade rolls and tests take a Desvantagem.
```

Draw Steel

```
Can’t Exceed Velocidade
A single Mover or other Efeito can never allow a criatura to Mover
more squares than their Velocidade, unless the Efeito states otherwise. For
example, a criatura with Velocidade 5 Músculo have that Velocidade reduced to 2
by the Lento Condição (see Conditions in Chapter 5: Classes). If an
aliado then alvos them with an Efeito that allows them to Mover up to
3 squares, the criatura can Mover only 2 squares because that’s their
current Velocidade.
```

**Can’t Cut Corners**

```
A criatura can’t Mover diagonally when doing so would involve passing
through the corner of a Parede or some other objeto that completely fills
the corner between the criatura’s space and the space they are moving
to. This rule applies only to moving past objetos, not moving past
other criaturas.
```

```
Cut Corners
The Tático moves 3 squares to exit the building without
cutting corners. The Cão de Guerra Eviscerita can’t Mover around the
side of the building in just 2 squares of Movimento, since they’d
have to cut a corner to do so.
```

**Shifting**

```
Shifting is a careful form of Movimento that allows a criatura to Mover
safely past dangerous foes. Certain abilities, features, and other rules
allow you to Ajustar-se a specific number of squares, sometimes up to your
Velocidade. Whenever you Ajustar-se, criaturas can’t make opportunity attacks
against you triggered by that Movimento (see Opportunity Attacks later
in this chapter).
You can’t Ajustar-se into or while within Terreno Difícil or Terreno Danoso
(see below). If a rule allows you to Ajustar-se, you can choose to instead Mover
up to the number of squares you would have shifted (for example, to
get out of Terreno Difícil). However, you can’t combine moving and
shifting within that Movimento.
```

**Movimento Types**

```
criaturas in the game can use eight types of Movimento: Andar, Escavar,
Escalar, Nadar, Pular, Rastejar, Voar, and Teleportar-se.
```

```
Andar
Walking is the most common Movimento Tipo, whether it refers to
ambulating on legs, rolling, slithering, or some other default method
of Movimento. Unless specified otherwise, all criaturas can Mover over
solid horizontal Chão without qualquer problem.
```

```
Escavar
A criatura who has “Escavar” in their Velocidade entry, or who gains the
temporary Habilidade to Escavar, can Mover through dirt horizontally, and
either has the means to breathe while doing so or doesn’t require Ar
to live. Such criaturas can’t Mover through more solid Chão, such as
Pedra, unless their Ficha de Criatura or the Efeito that lets them Escavar says
otherwise. Similarly, a Escavador criatura doesn’t leave a tunnel unless
the rules say so.
Cavar Manobra
It takes extra effort to Cavar vertically through the Chão as opposed to
tunneling horizontally, requiring a criatura to use a Especial Manobra. To
use the Cavar Manobra, a criatura must have “Escavar” in their Velocidade entry,
they must have a Velocidade that is equal to or greater than their Tamanho, and they
must be touching terrain that can be burrowed through.
```

```
When a criatura uses the Cavar Manobra, they can Mover vertically up to a
number of squares equal to their Tamanho. If a Escavador criatura has a criatura
who is not Inconsciente Agarrado, they can’t willingly Mover deeper into the
Chão. It’s too difficult to Cavar with a flailing inimigo in your Garras.
Targeting Escavador criaturas
If you are on the Chão, you have Linha of Efeito to a Escavador criatura if
that criatura occupies 1 or more squares of terrain that can be burrowed
through and that touch the Chão, and if you have Linha of Efeito to qualquer of
those squares. The Escavador criatura gains the Benefício of Cobertura from you.
```

```
If you are completely beneath the Chão while Escavador, you don’t have
Linha of Efeito to qualquer criatura on the surface unless a rule states otherwise.
If you are completely beneath the Chão while Escavador and are
Adjacente to another criatura who is Escavador, you have Linha of Efeito to
that criatura, though you both have Cobertura from each other.
```

```
You can’t gain the Benefício of high Chão (see below) against criaturas who
are completely beneath the Chão while Escavador.
Non-Escavador criaturas
If you are on the Chão and Adjacente to a criatura who is beneath the
Chão while Escavador, you can use a Manobra to Puxar that criatura
up 1 Quadrado out of the Chão, provided the criatura is willing.
```

```
If a criatura who can’t Escavar wants to Cavar into the Chão, they can
use the following Habilidade provided their Velocidade is 2 or more.
```

```
Cavoucar
— Manobra
e Personagem x Personagem
```

```
Poder Roll + Músculo :
á You can Mover 1 Quadrado into, out of, or through Chão you are
touching that can be burrowed through, and you are Lento
and Enfraquecido (FdT).
é You can use your Ação Principal this Turno to Mover 1 Quadrado
into, out of, or through Chão you are touching that can be
burrowed through, and you are Lento (FdT).
í You can Mover 1 Quadrado into, out of, or through Chão you are
touching that can be burrowed through.
```

```
Escavador Movimento Forçado
While a criatura who is completely beneath the Chão while
Escavador is force moved by Movimento that isn’t Vertical, they aren’t
moved, and they take 1 dano for each Quadrado they would have been
force moved. If the Movimento Forçado is Vertical, the criatura is moved
through the dirt as is if were Ar.
```

```
Combate
```

Escalar or Nadar
A criatura who has “Escalar” in their Velocidade entry, or who gains the
temporary Habilidade to automatically Escalar, can Escalar across Vertical and
horizontal surfaces at full Velocidade. Likewise, a criatura who has “Nadar” in
their Velocidade entry, or who gains the temporary Habilidade to automatically
Nadar, can Nadar in liquid at full Velocidade.

criaturas without those types of Movimento can still Escalar or Nadar
when a rule allows them to Mover, but each Quadrado of Escalador or
Nadador costs 2 squares of Movimento. If a surface is difficult to Escalar
(for instance, a sheer cliff or ice-covered Parede) or a liquid is hard to Nadar
through (a raging river or whirlpool), the Diretor can call for a Músculo Teste.
On a Falha, a criatura can’t Escalar or Nadar but wastes no Movimento in
the attempt. The Diretor can also impose other consequences to Falha,
such as being caught in the spinning current of a whirlpool.

**Escalador Other criaturas**
You can attempt to Escalar a criatura whose Tamanho is greater than yours. If
the criatura is willing, you can Escalar them without qualquer trouble. If the
criatura is unwilling, you make the following Teste:

```
Poder Roll + Músculo or Agilidade :
á You fail to Escalar the criatura, and they can make a Golpe Simples
against you.
é You fail to Escalar the criatura.
í You Escalar the criatura.
```

While you Escalar or Montar a criatura, you gain an Vantagem on Corpo-a-corpo abilities
used against them. The criatura can use a Manobra to attempt to
knock you off, forcing you to make the following Teste:

```
Poder Roll + Músculo or Agilidade :
á You fall off the criatura into an unoccupied Adjacente space of
your choice, taking Caindo dano and landing Derrubado as usual
(see Caindo below).
é You Deslizar down the criatura into an unoccupied Adjacente
space of your choice and don’t land Derrubado.
í You continue to hold on to the criatura.
```

If you are knocked Derrubado while Escalador or riding a criatura, you fall
and land Derrubado in an Adjacente space of your choice, taking dano as
usual from the fall.

Pular
Whenever an Efeito allows you to Mover (including using the Avançar
Ação de Movimento), you can automatically long Pular a number of squares up
to your Músculo or Agilidade score (your choice; minimum 1 Quadrado) as part
of that Movimento. The height of your Pular is automatically 1 Quadrado as
part of that Movimento.

If you want to Pular even longer or higher than your baseline Pular
allows, make a Músculo or Agilidade Teste:

```
Poder Roll + Músculo or Agilidade :
á You don’t Pular qualquer farther than your baseline Pular allows.
é You Pular 1 Quadrado longer and higher than your baseline Pular
allows.
í You Pular 2 squares longer and higher than your baseline
Pular allows.
```

You can’t Pular farther or higher than the Distância of the Efeito that
allows you to Mover. You can’t Pular out of Terreno Difícil or damaging
terrain (see below).

```
Rastejar
If you are Derrubado (see Conditions in Chapter 5: Classes), you can remain
Derrubado and Rastejar on the Chão. Doing so costs you 1 additional Quadrado
of Movimento for every Quadrado you Rastejar. If you intentionally want to
Rastejar, you can fall Derrubado as a Manobra Livre. While voluntarily Derrubado,
you can choose to stand as a Manobra Livre.
```

```
F ly
A criatura who has “Voar” in their Velocidade entry, or who gains the
temporary Habilidade to Voar, can Mover through the Ar vertically or horizon-
tally at full Velocidade and remain in midair. If a flying criatura is knocked
Derrubado or has their Velocidade reduced to 0, they fall (see Caindo below).
```

```
Pairar
A criatura who has “Pairar” in their Velocidade entry (most commonly
alongside “Voar” or “Teleportar-se”), or who gains the temporary Habilidade to
Pairar, can remain motionless in midair. They don’t fall even if they are
knocked Derrubado or their Velocidade is reduced to 0.
```

```
Teleportar-se
When a criatura teleports, they Mover from um space to another space
instantaneously. The following rules apply to teleporting:
¥ Teleporting doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks or other effects that
are triggered by a criatura moving.
¥ When a criatura teleports, they bypass qualquer obstacles between the
space they leave and their destination space.
¥ A criatura teleporting themself must have Linha of Efeito to their
destination space. A criatura teleporting another criatura must have
Linha of Efeito from the space the teleported criatura leaves and to
their destination space.
¥ A teleporting criatura’s destination space can’t be occupied by
another criatura or objeto.
¥ The Efeito that lets a criatura Teleportar-se indicates how far they can
Teleportar-se. That Distância can be greater than the criatura’s Velocidade.
¥ If a criatura can Teleportar-se as part of their usual Movimento, they can
use the Avançar Ação de Movimento to Teleportar-se a number of squares up to
their usual Velocidade, unmodified by conditions or effects.
¥ If a criatura teleports while Derrubado, they can be standing when they
Alcance their destination space provided they are able to stand. If a
Derrubado criatura is teleported by another criatura, it is up to that
criatura whether the teleported criatura remains Derrubado or stands if
they are able.
¥ If you Teleportar-se while affected by the Agarrado or Imobilizado conditions,
those conditions end for you.
¥ When a criatura teleports, they must leave the space where they
start and enter a new space. A criatura can’t Teleportar-se to and from
the same space.
```

**Caindo**

```
When a criatura falls 2 or more squares and lands on the Chão, they
take 2 dano for each Quadrado they fall (to a maximum of 50 dano)
and land Derrubado. A criatura who falls can reduce the effective height
of the fall by a number of squares equal to their Agilidade score (to a
minimum of 0). Caindo into liquid that is 1 Quadrado or more deep reduces
the effective height of a fall by 4 squares (to a minimum of 0).
Caindo is not Movimento Forçado, but being force moved downward is
considered Caindo (see Caindo below). Movimento from Caindo doesn’t
provoke opportunity attacks (see Opportunity Attacks below).
```

Draw Steel

```
Caindo Onto Another criatura
A criatura who falls and lands on another criatura causes that criatura
to take the same dano from the fall. The Caindo criatura then lands
Derrubado in the nearest quadrado desocupado of their choice. If the Caindo
criatura’s Tamanho is greater than the Músculo score of the criatura they land
on, that criatura is knocked Derrubado.
```

```
Caindo Far
When a criatura first falls from a great height, they fall 100 squares in
the first Ronda. At the end of each subsequent Ronda that they remain
Caindo, they fall another 100 squares.
```

```
Terreno Difícil
Areas of thick underbrush, rubble, spiderwebs, or other obstacles
to Movimento create Terreno Difícil. It costs 1 additional Quadrado of
Movimento to enter a Quadrado of Terreno Difícil.
```

**Terreno Danoso**

```
Areas of Ácido, Fogo, sharp rocks, lava, or qualquer other terrain that causes
dano to criaturas within it is Terreno Danoso. The dano dealt
by Terreno Danoso is noted in the terrain’s description or in the
description of the Efeito that creates the terrain.
High Chão
Whenever a criatura uses an Habilidade to alvo a criatura or objeto while
standing on the Chão and occupying a space that is fully above the
alvo’s space, they gain an Vantagem on the Poder roll against that alvo. To
be fully above a alvo, the bottom of a criatura’s space must be higher
than or bordering on the top of the alvo’s space.
```

```
A criatura can gain this Benefício while Escalador only if they have
“Escalar” in their Velocidade entry or can automatically Escalar at full Velocidade
while moving.
```

```
Movimento Forçado
Some actions and maneuvers allow a criatura to Empurrar, Puxar, or Deslizar a
alvo criatura or objeto a specific Distância across the battlefield. Collec-
tively, these types of Movimento are called Movimento Forçado.
```

```
Empurrar X: The criatura moves the alvo up to X squares away from
them in a straight Linha, without moving them vertically. Each
Quadrado the criatura moves the alvo must put the alvo farther
away from them.
Puxar X: The criatura moves the alvo up to X squares toward them
in a straight Linha, without moving them vertically. Each Quadrado the
criatura moves the alvo must bring the alvo closer to them.
Deslizar X: The criatura moves the alvo up to X squares in qualquer Direção,
except for vertically. Unlike a Empurrar or a Puxar, a Deslizar doesn’t need to
be a straight Linha.
When you force Mover a alvo, you can always Mover that alvo fewer
squares than the number indicated. For example, when the Conduíta
obtains a Grau 3 “Empurrar 3” outcome with their Invocar o Trovão
Habilidade, they can Empurrar alvos qualquer Distância up to 3 squares, including
choosing to not Mover certain alvos at all.
```

```
Movimento Forçado ignores Terreno Difícil and never provokes
opportunity attacks. When you force Mover a alvo into damaging
terrain or into terrain that produces an Efeito, they are affected as if they
had moved into it willingly.
```

```
Terreno Difícil
A Fúria with Velocidade 6 takes the Avançar Ação de Movimento across
a field with Água and bushes that create Terreno Difícil
(indicated by the blue squares on the map). Each highlighted
path indicates how many squares of Movimento they must
use while moving through or avoiding difficulty terrain. Their
Movimento can’t exceed 6 squares.
```

```
High Chão
The Talento stands atop a 3-Quadrado-high tower, which is higher
than qualquer other criatura. They gain an Vantagem on all Poder rolls
made against their inimigos in the diagram. The Goblin Assassino
and Cão de Guerra Comando stand on structures that are 2 squares
high. They gain an Vantagem on Habilidade rolls against the Tático,
who is standing on the Chão, but not against the Talento.
```

```
Combate
```

Vertical
If a Movimento Forçado Efeito has the word “Vertical” in front of it, then
the Movimento Forçado can Mover a alvo up or down in addition to hor-
izontally. For example, if a Movimento Forçado Efeito says “Vertical Empurrar
5,” then a criatura targeted by the Efeito can be pushed up to 5 squares
in qualquer Direção, as long as the Movimento Forçado is a straight Linha.

If a criatura who can’t Voar is left in midair at the end of a Vertical forced
Mover, they fall. Movimento Forçado made against a criatura who is flying
is always a Vertical forced Mover, whether or not the Efeito specifies it.

Though you can’t freely Empurrar, Puxar, or Deslizar a alvo up and down unless
that Movimento Forçado specifies “Vertical,” you can Mover them along a
physical slope such as a hill or staircase. For a alvo to be force moved
along a slope, each Quadrado of the slope can be no more than 1 Quadrado
higher or lower than the previous Quadrado.

Big Versus Little
When a larger criatura force moves a smaller alvo with a Corpo-a-corpo
Arma Habilidade, the Distância of the Movimento Forçado is increased by 1.
If a smaller criatura force moves a larger alvo with a Corpo-a-corpo Arma
Habilidade, the Distância doesn’t change.

Slamming into criaturas
When you force Mover a criatura into another criatura, the Movimento
ends and both criaturas take 1 dano for each Quadrado remaining in
the first criatura’s Movimento Forçado. You can also force Mover an objeto
into a criatura. The objeto’s Movimento ends, and the criatura takes 1
dano for each Quadrado remaining in the objeto’s Movimento Forçado.

```
It’s possible to Mover a criatura or objeto of a larger Tamanho into several
criaturas of a smaller Tamanho at the same time. When this happens, the
larger criatura in the collision takes dano only once, not once for
each smaller criatura they slam into.
```

```
If a criatura is killed by dano from an Habilidade or Efeito that also
force moves them, a second criatura they are slammed into still takes
dano unless the Diretor deems otherwise.
You can force Mover another criatura into yourself with a Puxar or a Deslizar.
```

```
Slamming Into criaturas
The Nulo slides a Cão de Guerra Comando 5 squares. The Nulo force
moves the Comando 1 Quadrado and then slams them into
another Adjacente Comando. The Movimento Forçado ends, and
both commandos take 4 dano, since the Movimento Forçado
still had 4 squares remaining when the commandos collided.
```

```
Movimento Forçado
The Fúria pushes a Cão de Guerra Comando 2 squares. The Censurador
pulls a Comando 2 squares. The Elementalista slides a
Comando 2 squares. Each Comando can end up anywhere
in the indicated Área of their Movimento Forçado on the diagram.
```

```
Vertical Movimento Forçado
The Talento verically slides the Goblin Corta-Espinhas 3 squares up
into the Ar and off of a cliff. The Goblin falls 5 squares, taking 10
dano and landing Derrubado from the fall.
```

```
Multitarget Abilities and Movimento Forçado
Some criaturas can force Mover multiple criaturas or objetos
with a single Habilidade. Unless the Habilidade specifies otherwise, the
criatura using the Habilidade determines the Ordem in which the
alvos are force moved. The criatura should select each alvo
individually and complete their Movimento Forçado before force
moving the next alvo affected.
```

Draw Steel

```
Slamming Into objetos
When a criatura force moves a alvo into a stationary objeto that is
the alvo’s Tamanho or larger and the objeto doesn’t break (see below), the
Movimento ends and the alvo takes 2 dano plus 1 dano for each
Quadrado remaining in their Movimento Forçado.
If you force Mover a criatura downward into an objeto that doesn’t
break (including the Chão), they also take Caindo dano as if they
had fallen the Distância force moved and their Agilidade score was 0 (see
Caindo above).
```

```
Arremesável Through objetos
When you Mover a criatura into a Mundano objeto, the objeto can break
depending on how many squares of Movimento Forçado remain. The cost
of being slammed into an objeto is tied to the dano a alvo takes for
being hurled through it:
¥ It costs 1 remaining Quadrado of Movimento Forçado to destroy 1 Quadrado
of glass. The criatura moved takes 3 dano.
¥ It costs 3 remaining squares of Movimento Forçado to destroy 1 Quadrado
of wood. The criatura moved takes 5 dano.
¥ It costs 6 remaining squares of Movimento Forçado to destroy 1 Quadrado
of Pedra. The criatura moved takes 8 dano.
¥ It costs 9 remaining squares of Movimento Forçado to destroy 1 Quadrado
of metal. The criatura moved takes 11 dano.
```

```
If qualquer Movimento Forçado remains after the objeto is destroyed, you can
continue to Mover the criatura who destroyed the objeto.
```

```
Forced Into a Fall
If you can’t Voar and are force moved across an Receptivo space that would
cause you to fall, such as being pushed over the Vantagem of a cliff, you
continue moving the total Distância you were moved first. If you are still
in a position to fall when the foced Movimento ends, you fall.
```

```
Estabilidade
Each criatura has a Estabilidade that allows them to resist forced
Movimento. When a criatura is force moved, they can reduce that
Movimento up to a number of squares equal to their Estabilidade. Heroes
start with Estabilidade 0 and can increase their Estabilidade through Linhagem,
Classe, and kit options.
A criatura’s Estabilidade can’t be less than 0, even when reduced
by a Penalidade.
```

```
“When a criatura Moves ...”
Certain abilities and effects Gatilho when a criatura moves into a
particular Área. Movimento Forçado triggers these options unless
otherwise noted, including an Efeito stating that a criatura must
willingly Mover to Gatilho it.
```

```
Morte Effects and Movimento Forçado
Some criaturas have traits or abilities that Gatilho when they die or
are reduced to 0 Vigor. If such a criatura is reduced to 0 Vigor by
dano from an Habilidade or Efeito that also force moves them, the forced
Movimento takes place before the triggered Efeito.
```

Mover Actions

```
A Ação de Movimento allows a criatura to Mover around the battlefield.
Sometimes you’ll already be exactly where you want to be so that you
don’t need to use a Ação de Movimento on your Turno. That’s okay! The decision
to not Mover is just as tactical as the decision to Mover.
```

```
Avançar
When a criatura takes the Avançar Ação de Movimento, they Mover a number
of squares up to their Velocidade. They can break up this Movimento with
their Manobra and Ação Principal however they wish.
```

**Retirar-se**

```
When a criatura takes the Retirar-se Ação de Movimento, they can Ajustar-se 1
Quadrado. Certain Classe features, kits, and other rules allow a criatura
to Ajustar-se more than 1 Quadrado when they Retirar-se. A criatura who
does so can break up their Ajustar-se with their Manobra and Ação Principal
however they wish.
```

```
Montar
A criatura can take the Montar Ação de Movimento only while mounted on
another criatura (see Mounted Combate below). When a criatura
takes the Montar Ação de Movimento, they cause their Montaria to Mover up to the
Montaria’s Velocidade, taking the rider with them. Alternatively, a criatura can
use the Montar Ação de Movimento to have their Montaria use the Retirar-se Mover
action as a Reação Livre. A criatura can use the Montar Ação de Movimento
only once per Ronda. A mounted criatura can only have this Mover
action applied to them once per Ronda. This Movimento can be broken
up with the rider’s Manobra and Ação Principal however they wish.
```

```
Arremesável Through objetos
The Nulo slides a Cão de Guerra Comando 5 squares. The Nulo force
moves the Comando 1 Quadrado and then slams them into a
thick wooden Parede. The Nulo forces the Comando through the
first Quadrado of the Parede by using 3 squares of Movimento Forçado,
resulting in the Comando taking 5 dano. The Comando
still has 1 Quadrado of Movimento Forçado left, so they are pushed
into the next Quadrado of the Parede, which doesn’t break but does
result in the Comando’s forced moment ending and them
taking another 3 dano: 1 for the Quadrado of Movimento Forçado
leftover and 2 for colliding with an objeto.
```

```
Tracking objeto Forced-Movimento dano
At the Diretor’s discretion, Mundano objetos that are force
moved into criaturas or other objetos take dano as if they
were criaturas. Sturdy objetos can take dano as follows
before they are destroyed:
¥ Wood objeto: 3 dano for each Quadrado it occupies
¥ Pedra objeto: 6 dano for each Quadrado it occupies
¥ Metal objeto: 9 dano for each Quadrado it occupies
More fragile objetos are destroyed after taking qualquer dano.
```

```
Combate
```

Maneuvers

A Manobra typically involves less Foco and exertion than a Ação Principal
(see below). It can be an opportunity to Mover other criaturas, drink a
potion, or undertake similar activities.

Sometimes you Músculo not have anything you can do with your Manobra.
That’s totally fine! Often, the best thing to do on your Turno is take a main
action and Mover on.

**Auxiliar Ataque**

A criatura who uses the Auxiliar Ataque Manobra chooses an inimigo Adjacente
to them. The next Habilidade roll an aliado makes against that inimigo before the
start of the aiding criatura’s next Turno gains an Vantagem.

**Recuperar Fôlego**

A criatura who uses the Recuperar Fôlego Manobra spends a Recuperação and
regains Vigor equal to their Recuperação value. (See below for Vigor. See
Recoveries in Chapter 1: The Basics.)

A criatura who is Morrendo (see Morrendo and Morte in Vigor below) can’t
use the Recuperar Fôlego Manobra, but other criaturas can help them Gastar
Recoveries in other ways.

**Escapar Agarrão**

A criatura who is Agarrado by another criatura, an objeto, or an Efeito (see
Agarrar below) can attempt to escape by using the following Habilidade.

```
Escapar Agarrão
— Manobra
e Personagem x Personagem
```

```
Poder Roll + Músculo or Agilidade :
á No Efeito.
é You can escape the Agarrar, but if you do, a criatura who has you
Agarrado can make a Corpo-a-corpo Golpe Simples against you before you
are no longer Agarrado.
í You are no longer Agarrado.
Efeito: You take a Desvantagem on this Manobra if your Tamanho is smaller than
the Tamanho of the criatura, objeto, or Efeito that has you Agarrado.
```

See Conditions in Chapter 5: Classes for information on the
Agarrado Condição.

**Agarrar**

A criatura tentando to keep a foe close and locked down can attempt to
Agarrar a criatura using the following Habilidade.

```
Agarrar
Corpo-a-corpo, Arma Manobra
e Corpo-a-corpo 1 x um criatura
```

```
Poder Roll + Músculo :
á No Efeito.
é You can Agarrar the alvo, but if you do, the alvo can make a
Corpo-a-corpo Golpe Simples against you before they are Agarrado.
í The alvo is Agarrado by you.
Efeito: You can usually alvo only criaturas of your Tamanho or smaller.
If your Músculo score is 2 or higher, you can alvo qualquer criatura with a
Tamanho equal to or less than your Músculo score.
```

Unless otherwise indicated, a criatura can Agarrar only um criatura at a time.

See Conditions in Chapter 5: Classes for information on the
Agarrado Condição.

```
Esconder-se
Using the Esconder-se Manobra, a criatura attempts to Esconder-se from other
criaturas who aren’t observing them while they have Cobertura or
Encobrimento. See Esconder-se and Furtivo in Chapter 9: Tests for full details.
```

```
Empurrar
A criatura wanting to Empurrar an Adjacente criatura away from them can
attempt to shove that criatura using the following Habilidade.
```

```
Empurrar
Corpo-a-corpo, Arma Manobra
e Corpo-a-corpo 1 x 1 criatura
```

```
Poder Roll + M ight:
á Empurrar 1
é Empurrar 2
í Empurrar 3
Efeito: You can usually alvo only criaturas of your Tamanho or smaller.
If your Músculo score is 2 or higher, you can alvo qualquer criatura with a
Tamanho equal to or less than your Músculo score.
```

```
Hiding
To become Escondida, the Sombra can’t be observed by the Guerra
dog Crucibita, so they must get out of the Crucibita’s Linha of
Efeito. In this situation, the Sombra could do this by moving to
put a Parede between them and the Crucibita or moving up onto
a roof.
```

Draw Steel

```
Make or Auxiliar um Teste
Many tests are maneuvers if made durante o Combate. Searching a chest with
a Razão Teste, picking a door’s lock with an Agilidade Teste, or lifting a
portcullis with a Músculo Teste would all be maneuvers. Assisting a Teste is
also a Manobra durante o Combate (see Auxiliar um Teste in Chapter 9: Tests).
```

```
Complex or time-consuming tests Músculo require a Ação Principal if
made durante o Combate—or could take so long that they can’t be made during
Combate at all. Other tests that take no time at all, such as a Razão Teste
to Recolher lore about mummies, are usually free maneuvers durante o Combate.
The Diretor has the final say regarding which tests can be made
as maneuvers.
```

```
Procurar Criaturas Escondidas
The Procurar Criaturas Escondidas Manobra allows a criatura to
attempt to locate criaturas Escondida from them (see Esconder-se and Furtivo in
Chapter 9: Tests).
```

**Levantar**

```
A criatura can use the Levantar Manobra to Levantar if they are
Derrubado, ending that Condição. Alternatively, they can use this Manobra
to make a willing Adjacente Derrubado criatura Levantar.
```

```
Usar Consumível
Unless otherwise noted in its description, a criatura can Ativar
a Consumível Tesouro such as a potion with the Usar Consumível
Manobra. A criatura can use this Manobra to administer a
Consumível Tesouro that benefits the user either to themself or to a
willing Adjacente criatura. See Consumables in Chapter 13: Rewards.
```

Main Actions

```
When you take a Ação Principal, you most often do so to use a unique
Habilidade granted by your Classe, kit, or a Tesouro (see Abilities in
Chapter 5: Classes). These abilities represent the most unique, flavorful,
and impactful things you can do with your Ação Principal.
You can also use your Ação Principal to catch your Sopro, help another
criatura regain Vigor, Investir into battle, Defensor yourself, or make a
Golpe Simples.
```

```
You can convert your Ação Principal into a Manobra or a Ação de Movimento,
allowing you to take dois maneuvers or Mover actions on your Turno.
```

```
Investir
When a criatura takes the Investir Ação Principal, they Mover up to their
Velocidade in a straight Linha, then make a Corpo-a-corpo Golpe Simples (see Free Strikes
below) against a alvo when they end their Mover. If the criatura has an
Habilidade with the Investir Palavra-Chave, they can use that Habilidade against the
alvo instead of a Golpe Simples.
```

```
A criatura can’t Mover through Terreno Difícil or Ajustar-se when they
Investir. They can Voar or Escavar as part of the Investir Ação Principal if they
have that Movimento available to them, but they can’t Escalar or Nadar
while charging unless they can automatically use that Movimento
at full Velocidade.
```

```
Defensor
When a criatura takes the Defensor Ação Principal, Habilidade rolls made
against them have a double Desvantagem até o início do seu próximo turno.
Additionally, you have a double Vantagem on tests when called for to resist
environmental effects or a criatura’s traits or abilities. A criatura gains
no Benefício from this action while another criatura is Provocado by them
(see Conditions in Chapter 5: Classes).
```

**Golpe Simples**

```
A criatura can use this Ação Principal to make a Golpe Simples (see Free
Strikes below). Most of the time, you’ll want to use the more impactful
main actions granted by your Classe, kit, or other Recurso, just as the
Diretor will use the main actions in a criatura’s Ficha de Criatura, but free
strikes are available for when all else fails. For instance, a Fúria who has
no other options for À Distância strikes Músculo use the À Distância Arma Free
Golpe Habilidade with an improvised Arma when battling a flying foe.
```

```
Curar
A criatura who uses the Curar Ação Principal employs medicine or
inspiring words to make an Adjacente criatura feel better and stay in
the fight. The alvo criatura can Gastar a Recuperação to regain Vigor,
or can make a Teste de Resistência against um Efeito they are suffering that is
ended by a Teste de Resistência.
```

```
Combate
```

Free Strikes

Every criatura can use a Golpe Simples Habilidade as a Ação Principal on their
Turno, though doing so typically isn’t the most effective choice. Most of
the time, you’ll use free strikes when the rules call for it. Specific rules
let you use free strikes as part of an action that allows you to also do
something else impactful, such as how the Investir Ação Principal lets you
Mover and use a Corpo-a-corpo Golpe Simples in um Ação Principal (see Investir above).

Many rules and abilities allow heroes to make free strikes when it
isn’t their Turno, such as the Tático’s Cobertura Habilidade. As well, all
characters can make an Ataque de Oportunidade Golpe Simples.

**Granted Abilities**

Some abilities, such as the Tático’s Golpe Now or I’ll Receptivo and
You’ll Close abilities, allow another criatura to use a signature Habilidade
or heroic Habilidade when it isn’t their Turno. Unless otherwise stated, a
criatura can always use a Golpe Simples instead of a granted signature
Habilidade or heroic Habilidade.

**Opportunity Attacks**

Whenever a criatura has an inimigo Adjacente to them and the inimigo
willingly moves to a space that isn’t Adjacente to the criatura without
shifting, the criatura can take advantage of that Movimento to quickly
make a Corpo-a-corpo Golpe Simples against the inimigo as a Reação Livre.
This is called an Ataque de Oportunidade.

If a criatura has a Desvantagem or double Desvantagem on the Poder roll against the
inimigo, they can’t make an Ataque de Oportunidade.

**Standard Free Strikes**

Every Herói has dois standard Golpe Simples abilities available to them. Your
Classe Músculo give you additional Golpe Simples options, and your kit can
improve the standard options (see Chapter 6: Kits).

A Corpo-a-corpo Arma Golpe Simples is a Corpo-a-corpo Golpe made with an unarmed
Golpe or an improvised Arma. A À Distância Arma Golpe Simples is a À Distância
Golpe made with an improvised Arma. At the Diretor’s discretion,
the dano Tipo of an improvised Arma can change based on the
objeto used. For example, if you use a Queimando torch as an improvised

Opportunity Attacks
The Tático can’t make qualquer opportunity attacks against
these Adjacente Cães de Guerra as they Mover. Despite moving, the
Comando never stops being Adjacente to the Tático, and the
Crucibita shifts away instead of moving.
```

```
Opportunity Attacks: Moving Out
A Cão de Guerra Crucibita moves out of a space that is Adjacente to the
Tático and into a space that isn’t Adjacente. The Tático can
make an Ataque de Oportunidade against the Crucibita.
```

```
Opportunity Attacks: Moving With Banes
The Cão de Guerra eviservite has a Desvantagem on strikes against the
Adjacente Censurador, so the Censurador can freely Mover away from the
evisercite without worrying about the Cão de Guerra making an
Ataque de Oportunidade.

Flanqueando
When you and um or more aliados are Adjacente to the same inimigo and
on opposite sides of the inimigo, you are Flanqueando that inimigo. While
Flanqueando an inimigo, you gain an Vantagem on Corpo-a-corpo strikes against them.
```

```
If you’re unsure whether your Herói and an aliado are Flanqueando a foe,
imagine a Linha extending from the center of your space to the center of
your aliado’s space. If that Linha passes through opposite sides or corners of
the inimigo’s space, then you and your aliado are Flanqueando the inimigo.
You must have Linha of Efeito to the inimigo and be able to take triggered
actions to gain or grant the Flanqueando Benefício.
```

```
Flanqueando
The tacitician flanks the Cão de Guerra Amalgamita with the
Elementalista and Talento, since they are on directly opposite
sides of their inimigo. No heroes flank the other Amalgamita.
The Censurador, using an Habilidade with a Distância of Corpo-a-corpo 2, isn’t
Adjacente to the Amalgamita and so can’t flank with the Sombra.
The Fúria and Nulo aren’t on directly opposite sides of the
Amalgamita, and so they aren’t Flanqueando their inimigo either.
```

```
Flanqueando
The Censurador flanks the Cão de Guerra Comando with the Fúria,
since they are on directly opposite sides of their inimigo. The
Trovador isn’t Flanqueando the criatura with the Censurador though,
since they aren’t on directly opposite sides. The Sombra can’t
flank the Crucibita with the Conduíta because the Conduíta is
Atordoado, which prevents them from taking triggered actions.
```

```
Cobertura
The Cão de Guerra Comando has Cobertura against a Golpe from the
tacitician, since a low Parede between them covers half of the
Comando’s body. The tacitician can’t attack the Crucibita,
since much higher walls completely block the Crucibita’s body,
and therefore the tacitician does not have Linha of Efeito to the
Crucibita.
```

Cobertura

```
When you have Linha of Efeito to a criatura or objeto but that alvo has
at least half their form blocked by a solid objeto such as a tree, Parede, or
overturned table, the alvo has Cobertura. You take a Desvantagem on dano-deal-
ing abilities used against criaturas or objetos that have Cobertura from you.
```

Encobrimento

```
Darkness, Névoa, invisibility Magia, and qualquer other Efeito that fully obscures
a criatura or objeto but doesn’t protect their physical form grants that
criatura or objeto Encobrimento. Even if you have Linha of Efeito to such
a alvo, a criatura or objeto has Encobrimento from you if you can’t see
or otherwise observe them. You can alvo a criatura or objeto with
Encobrimento using a Golpe, provided they aren’t Escondida (see Esconder-se
and Furtivo in Chapter 9: Tests). However, strikes against such alvos
take a Desvantagem.
```

**Invisível criaturas**

```
Invisível criaturas always have Encobrimento from other criaturas. If an
Invisível criatura isn’t Escondida, they can still be targeted by abilities. The
Teste made to find a Escondida criatura who is Invisível takes a Desvantagem.
```

```
Encobrimento
The Tático is shrouded in Névoa, which provides them with
Encobrimento against a Golpe from the Cão de Guerra Crucibita. The
Crucibita’s Golpe takes a Desvantagem as a result.
```

```
Combate
```

```
Vigor
Your Herói’s survivability is represented by your Vigor. Think of
Vigor as a combination of a criatura’s physical vitality and their
overall energy for dodging and resisting incoming blows, spells, and
other violence. It’s not that every instance of dano deals a Sangrando
wound to you, but that each um chips away at your Habilidade to fight
effectively. um attack Músculo make you sweat as you Pulo back to
avoid an arrow, while another Músculo graze your elbow with a dagger
nick, leaving a dull, distracting pain. Eventually, this Drenante of energy
leaves you Receptivo for bigger blows that can truly harm your body—or
possibly kill you.
```

```
After qualquer dano you take is reduced by Imunidade a Dano or other
effects, your Vigor is reduced by an amount equal to the remaining
dano. Some effects can also reduce your Vigor maximum, limiting
the amount of Vigor you can regain.
```

```
Recoveries and Recuperação Value
Each Herói has a number of Recoveries determined by their Classe. A
Herói also has a Recuperação value that equals um-third of their Vigor
maximum, rounded down. When you use the Recuperar Fôlego Manobra
durante o Combate (see Maneuvers above), you Gastar a Recuperação and regain
Vigor equal to your Recuperação value. fora de Combate, you can
Gastar as many Recoveries as you have remaining. Some abilities, items,
and other effects allow you to Gastar a Recuperação to regain Vigor
equal to your Recuperação value plus a little extra (as described by the
Efeito), or to regain Vigor without spending a Recuperação.
```

dano

Strikes, Área attacks, environmental effects, and other hazards can all
deal dano to the heroes and their foes. Whenever a criatura takes
dano, they reduce their Vigor (see below) by an amount equal to
the dano taken.

**dano Types**

Typical dano, such as that caused by weapons, Caindo, traps, and
monstrous Garras, has no Tipo associated with it. That’s because for
most criaturas, there’s no difference in the amount of harm caused by
being run through with a pike, dropped from a height onto a Pedra floor,
slashed by a pendulum scythe, or skewered on a Minotauro’s horns.

However, when it comes to Elemental and Sobrenatural dano
sources, some criaturas Músculo have an immunity or weakness to that
dano. As such, abilities and effects note when they deal qualquer of the
following dano types: Ácido, Frio, Corrupção, Fogo, Sagrado, Elétrico,
Veneno, Psíquico, or Sônico.

Imunidade a Dano
Imunidade a Dano means that a criatura can ignore some or all of the
dano they would usually take from certain attacks or effects.

Imunidade a Dano Músculo have a dano Tipo associated with it,
expressed as “[dano Tipo] immunity.” Imunidade a Dano often has a
value associated with it, so that um criatura’s Ficha de Criatura notes “dano
immunity 5” (representing immunity to all dano), while another
criatura has “Elétrico immunity 5.” Whenever a alvo with dano
immunity takes dano of the indicated Tipo, they can reduce the
dano by the value of the immunity (to a minimum of 0 dano). If
the value of the immunity is “all,” then the alvo ignores all dano of
the indicated Tipo.

Imunidade a Dano should be the last thing applied when calculating
dano. For instance, if your Herói has Fogo immunity 5 and takes 8 Fogo
dano, they take 3 dano. But if an aliado first halved the dano with
a Reação, your Herói would take 4 dano before immunity is
applied, with immunity then reducing the dano to 0.

If multiple dano immunities apply to a source of dano, only the
immunity with the highest value applies. For instance, a criatura with
Imunidade a Dano 5 and Fogo immunity 10 who takes 12 Fogo dano
reduces the dano by 10 points.

Fraqueza a Dano
Fraqueza a Dano works like Imunidade a Dano, except that criaturas
take extra dano whenever they take dano of the indicated
Tipo. For instance, if a criatura has Fogo weakness 5 and is dealt 10 Fogo
dano, they take 15 Fogo dano instead.

A criatura who has “Fraqueza a Dano X” with no specific Tipo or
Palavra-Chave indicated has weakness of the indicated amount when they
take dano of qualquer Tipo.

If a criatura has both Imunidade a Dano and Fraqueza a Dano for a
source of dano, apply the weakness first, then the immunity.

If multiple dano weaknesses apply to a source of dano, only the
weakness with the highest value applies.

Draw Steel

```
Ofegante
Your Ofegante value equals half your Vigor maximum. When your
Vigor is equal to or less than your Ofegante value, you are Ofegante.
Although being Ofegante has no effects on its own, certain Linhagem,
Classe, item, Título, and Monstro abilities affect Ofegante criaturas.
```

```
You can tell when other criaturas are Ofegante and vice versa.
```

```
Morrendo and Morte
When your Vigor is 0 or lower, you are Morrendo. While Morrendo, you
can’t use the Recuperar Fôlego Manobra durante o Combate. Additionally, you are
Sangrando, and this instance of the Condição can’t be negated or removed
in qualquer way until you are no longer Morrendo. While you are Morrendo, you can
still act, your aliados can help you Gastar Recoveries durante o Combate, and you
can Gastar Recoveries out of Combate as usual.
```

```
While your Vigor is lower than 0, if it reaches the negative of your
Ofegante value, you die. When you die, you can’t be brought back to
Vida without the use of a Especial powerful item, such as a Scroll of
Resurrection.
```

```
Diretor-Controlled criaturas
In most circumstances, Diretor-controlled criaturas die or are
destroyed when their Vigor drops to 0.
```

```
No Recoveries
Diretor-controlled criaturas don’t have Recoveries or a Recuperação value.
qualquer such criaturas who regain Vigor during a battle do so by way of
a Especial item or an Habilidade in their Ficha de Criatura. However, there are times
when a Herói Músculo wish to use an Habilidade that allows another criatura
to Gastar a Recuperação or to regain Vigor equal to their Recuperação value
on an injured NPC. In such cases, a Diretor-controlled criatura regains
Vigor equal to um-third of their Vigor maximum.
```

**Knocking criaturas Out**

```
If you dano a criatura with an Habilidade that would kill them, you can
choose to instead knock them Inconsciente. If a criatura takes dano
while Inconsciente in this way, they die.
Diretor-controlled criaturas remain Inconsciente for 1 hour if no um
does anything to wake them. They then gain 1 Vigor and are no
longer Inconsciente.
```

```
Heroes remain Inconsciente for 1 hour if no um does anything to
wake them. After 1 hour, they can Gastar a Recuperação and are no longer
Inconsciente. If the Herói has no Recoveries left, they can’t wake up until
they finish a Descanso.
```

```
Inconsciente
While you are Inconsciente, you can’t take main actions, maneuvers,
triggered actions, free triggered actions, or free maneuvers; your
Velocidade is 0; you are unaware of your surroundings; and you are Derrubado.
Habilidade rolls against you have a double Vantagem. If you wake up from being
Inconsciente, you can Levantar from Derrubado as a Manobra Livre.
```

```
Temporary Vigor
Some abilities, treasures, and other effects grant a criatura temporary
Vigor. Temporary Vigor shouldn’t be included in a criatura’s
Vigor total when figuring out a criatura’s Recuperação value or Ofegante
value. If you have temporary Vigor while Ofegante, Morrendo, or dead, the
temporary Vigor doesn’t change those states.
```

```
Whenever you take dano while you have temporary Vigor, the
temporary Vigor decreases first, and qualquer leftover dano is applied
to your Vigor as usual. For instance, if you have 10 temporary
Vigor and take 16 dano, you lose the temporary Vigor and then
lose another 6 Vigor.
There is no maximum to how much temporary Vigor you can
have. Regaining Vigor can’t restore temporary Vigor. If you have
temporary Vigor and then gain more temporary Vigor, you
get whichever amount of temporary Vigor is greater, rather than
adding the dois pools together. For instance, if an Habilidade grants you 10
temporary Vigor when you already have 5, you have 10 temporary
Vigor, not 15.
```

```
Unless otherwise indicated, temporary Vigor disappears at the end
of an Encontro.
```

```
objeto Vigor
Mundano objetos in the game have Vigor based on the material
they’re made of. When an objeto’s Vigor is reduced to 0, the objeto
is destroyed. objetos have Veneno immunity all and Psíquico immunity
all, though the Diretor can remove um or both of these immunities in
the case of living objetos, such as plants. A Tamanho 1 objeto or 1 Quadrado of a
larger objeto made of common materials has Vigor as follows:
```

```
¥ Glass: 1 Vigor
¥ Wood: 3 Vigor
¥ Pedra: 6 Vigor
¥ Metal: 9 Vigor
The Diretor can decide that a well-made or poorly made objeto has
more or less Vigor. Destroying a Sobrenatural objeto often (but not
always) requires a specific quest, such as throwing a Magia ring back
into the volcano where it was forged.
```

Underwater Combate

```
If a criatura is fully submerged in Água, they have Fogo immunity 5 and
Elétrico weakness 5. If they can’t automatically Nadar at full Velocidade
while moving, their Poder rolls take a Desvantagem.
```

```
Sufocando
During Combate or under similarly stressful circumstances, you can hold
your Sopro for a number of Combate rounds equal to your Músculo score
(minimum 1 Ronda). At the end of each Combate Ronda after that, you
take 1d6 dano while holding your Sopro.
```

```
Out of Combate, you can hold your Sopro for a number of minutes equal
to your Músculo score. Being unable to breathe after that time counts as a
stressful Condição, causing you to run out of Ar as above.
```

```
Combate
```

Mounted Combate

A willing criatura with the Montaria role (see criatura Roles in
_Draw Steel: Monsters_ ) can serve as your Montaria as long as their Tamanho
is greater than yours. You can Escalar onto your Montaria freely (see
Escalador Other criaturas above). You determine which space you
occupy. While mounted, you can take the Montar Ação de Movimento, but a
Montaria can only be ridden this way once per Ronda. Both Montaria and
rider each take a Turno during Combate.

If a criatura riding a Montaria is force moved, they are knocked off
the Montaria and must Fazer um Teste to determine how they land (see
Escalador Other criaturas). If a Montaria is force moved, they carry qualquer
riders with them. Riders and mounts Teleportar-se separately.

If your Montaria dies, they fall Derrubado, and you fall off them and land Derrubado
in the nearest quadrado desocupado of your choice.

End of Combate

At the end of Combate, the Diretor determines if the heroes earn qualquer
Victories. qualquer Efeito or Condição on you that you suffered during
Combate (except for being Ofegante, Inconsciente, or Morrendo) ends if
you want it to.

**How Combate Ends**

The Diretor determines when a Combate Encontro is over. While some
battles—especially showdowns with important villains—can be about
a fight to the bitter end, many other encounters can become a tedious
slog if the heroes need to fight until every last inimigo’s Vigor is
reduced to 0.

To avoid a battle dragging, the Diretor can set objectives when they
build the Encontro. Once the heroes achieve those objectives, or if
it becomes Tempo Limpo that they can win the fight with minimal effort, the
Diretor can end the Encontro. They Músculo do so by calling “Cut!” like
a film Diretor, or they can use some other phrase or indicator.

When the Diretor ends Combate this way, the jogadores typically choose
how the battle ends by narrating a dramatic finish. Or in rarer cases
when the heroes achieve a major Objetivo that sets off a story-defin-
ing event, the Diretor narrates the end of the battle with a positive
outcome for the jogadores, called an event ending (see below).

**Objetivo Endings**

While planning a Combate Encontro, the Diretor can set um or more
objectives the heroes can achieve to end the Encontro without
dropping every last foe. Some broad categories of objectives are
described in this section, but the Diretor should feel free to create their
own. As well, Directors can always end Combate anytime it becomes
Tempo Limpo that the heroes are going to win an Encontro with minimal effort,
even if they haven’t achieved all the objectives.

Each of the Objetivo endings in this section is explored in detail—
including looking at Monstro roles, map advice, Sucesso conditions, and
more—in the Introduction section of _Draw Steel: Monsters_.

Diminish Numbers
The simplest Combate Encontro Objetivo is almost always “defeat them
before they defeat us.” Though the heroes don’t have to kill every last
inimigo in this Tipo of Encontro, winning the day requires that they Empurrar
their opponents to the point where they are broken, flee, or surrender.

```
Defeat a Specific Foe
An Encontro built around defeating a specific foe includes um or
more of the heroes’ inimigos commanding the rest, such as a hobgoblin
Lorde de Sangue Conduzindo a group of mercenaries, or um or more particularly
powerful foes among a group of weaker ones, such as a pair of tusker
demons in a Gnoll Guerra band. Because these more-powerful inimigos are
the stars of the Encontro, if only Fraca foes are left once the stars are
gone, the battle loses its Desafio and it’s time to wrap it up. It makes
sense for those weaker foes to flee or surrender once their strongest
aliados have gone down.
```

```
Get the Thing!
Classic heroic fantasy is full of important objetos that the heroes must
protect from the forces of evil: Magia rings, royal birth certificates,
Dragão eggs, and the like. Heroes often find themselves at violent odds
with their inimigos as they race to collect a valuable or important item
from a guarded temple or castle, or when they need to steal the item
from a group of inimigos already in possession of it.
Objectives in this category work well when paired with other
objectives, such as defeating a specific foe. For instance, the heroes must
steal a ledger containing a record of Criminoso activity from an Supermente
and her lackeys. However, even if they obtain the ledger, the battle
won’t be over until they also defeat the Supermente, who won’t let the
book go without a fight!
```

Draw Steel

```
Destroy the Thing!
Combate doesn’t always have to be about destroying your inimigos.
Sometimes it’s about destroying their stuff! Queimando a Pirata Capitão’s
vessel, closing a portal to the Abissal Wasteland before it lets in an
army of demons, or shutting down a massive kobold Armadilha made of
Lâminas Giratórias could so hamper the heroes’ foes that the battle is no
longer worth fighting once the dano is done.
```

```
Save Another
No um earns the mantle of Herói without saving a few lives. Sometimes
the point of an Encontro isn’t to kill, but to save as many folks as you
can. If the heroes rescue powerful aliados from the clutches of their foes
during Combate, the added strength of those aliados Músculo be enough
to make the remainder of the Encontro trivial. When you and your
companions save a Grifo from a crew of poachers, the hunters become
the ... well, you know the rest.
```

```
Escort
Surprising as it may seem, sometimes the Destino of the mission doesn’t
rest on the heroes’ shoulders at all! Sometimes it rests on the shoulders
of someone standing next to the heroes. The heroes’ job is to keep this
important person safe as they travel to a specific destination.
Not every escort Encontro is on behalf of a wise or mighty aliado.
Sometimes the heroes are tasked with protecting a helpless or even an
actively troublesome criatura, such as a hapless Nobre or a wayward
child. They Músculo even have to protect a bulky or inconvenient
inanimate objeto. Whatever the case, the inimigos just keep coming
until the heroes get their Investir to their destination.
```

```
Hold Them Off
Sometimes the heroes just need to buy time. They Músculo need to
battle a conquering tyrant’s army to allow innocent villagers time to
escape. They Músculo need to hold off Ondulante after Ondulante of zombies while
a group of priests completes a ritual to lay the Morto-Vivo to rest for good.
To achieve this Objetivo, the heroes need to stay alive and protect a
particular position for a number of rounds determined by you.
```

```
Assault the Defenses
The inimigo holds a strategically important position and the heroes
want it. The Encontro ends when the heroes secure the Objetivo
defensive location for themselves, even if there are more inimigos
outside it. Sometimes an Encontro with this Objetivo is part of a
combined Objetivo, as when heroes must first assault the defenses,
then hold that defensive position against counterattack.
```

```
Stop the Action
Sometimes Combate is complicated by the fact that the heroes need to
stop the villainous actions of their foes. It’s not enough to simply defeat
the warriors in a cult. The heroes must also stop the zealots’ archdev-
il-summoning ritual! Or it Músculo be that the heroes need to interrupt
a wedding and make sure an evil mage doesn’t marry the heir to the
throne. Despite Combate, the mage forces the ceremony to continue!
Objectives in this category have a timer associated with them. If the
heroes don’t achieve the Objetivo in a certain number of rounds, the
conditions of the battle could well change. For instance, if the cultists
summon the archdevil, defeating the Diabo suddenly becomes the
heroes’ new Objetivo!
```

```
Complete the Action
This Encontro Objetivo sees the characters charged with initiating
an event, performing a ritual, and so forth. For instance, if the heroes
are attempting to launch an airship while repelling a Invasor do Futuro
boarding party, the Encontro could be over the moment the heroes
manage to Ativar the vessel and take off with just a few time raiders
actually aboard.
```

```
Dramatic Finish
If the heroes are able to end a fight with a dramatic finish, the Diretor
assigns each Herói um or more of their remaining inimigos, then asks
that Herói’s jogador to describe how the Herói neutralizes that threat. The
Herói Músculo deliver a killing blow, knock their foe out, or let the inimigo
flee with their tail between their legs (literally or figuratively). If the
fight has more heroes than Diretor-controlled inimigos, the Diretor
can assign more than um Herói to an inimigo, then ask the jogadores
how their characters work together to bring that inimigo down. After
everyone gives a description, the battle ends.
```

**Event Ending**

```
If the Diretor calls the end of Combate when a specific Objetivo in
an Encontro is achieved, the event ending creates a big narrative
finish. The Diretor can pick a narrative Gatilho for an event ending
before an Encontro begins, or can come up with um on the Voar if that
makes more sense.
Event endings can Cobertura big scenarios such as the characters destroying
a dam to unleash a river upon their inimigos, or completing a ritual
that causes all the demons they’ve been battling to be sent back to the
Abissal Wasteland, accompanied by visual details. For example, if the
heroes are battling a necromancer who controls a Horda of zombies, the
Morto-Vivo Músculo all crumble to dust when the necromancer is defeated. If
the heroes destroy an eldritch machine sapping the land of its natural
energy, the Onda de Choque from the device’s destruction could vaporize the
cultists attempting to protect it.
```

```
Fleeing Foes
If you’ve played a fantasy RPG before, odds are you’ve had an
Encontro where you didn’t chase down every last fleeing
foe—and then um such foe Agarrado another bunch of evil
buddies and came back to ambush you. It takes only um
experience like this to create jogadores who promise, “No
survivors. No mercy!” whenever foes break ranks. Chasing
down every last foe can be fun once in a while, but it can easily
Turno a tactical Encontro into a slog.
Luckily, this is a heroic game. Although the Diretor can
surprise the jogadores with dramatic reveals and twisty-turny
stories, “Gotcha!” moments that make jogadores Desconfiado of
every fleeing bandit shouldn’t be part of those stories. If a
bandit is fleeing an Encontro, they’re running away to rethink
their Vida. If they’re going for help, the jogadores should get some
sense of that—for example, the bandit screaming at the top
of their lungs for help as they run toward their Líder’s tent.
That way, the jogadores can process what’s happening, and will
understand that stopping that fleeing bandit is part of the
Desafio of the Encontro.

Negociação
```

```
Chapter 11
```

# **Negociação**

Negociar dá aos heróis uma chance de conseguir o que querem sem combate... ou ao menos sem mais combate! Você pode negociar com um rei para obter apoio militar contra uma invasão demoníaca em um reino vizinho. Você pode tentar convencer uma líder de bandidos a parar de atacar caravanas de mercadores na estrada e, em vez disso, mirar em nobres leais a um tirano. Você pode tentar convencer um arquimago a permitir acesso à sua biblioteca secreta para pesquisar a localização de um machado matador-de-dragões. A Negociação cobre todos esses cenário e mais.

Pense na Negociação como aprender um novo sistema de combate, exploração ou investigação em um RPG. Este conjunto de regras oferece uma estrutura para interpretação. As regras de Negociação devem ser lidas tanto por jogadores quanto por Diretores, para que todos entendam as regras de Negociação. Se você nunca jogou um jogo com um sistema de Negociação dedicado como esse, você pode precisar passar por ele uma ou duas vezes antes de dominá-lo, assim como para aprender qualquer subconjunto de regras de um RPG. Se um jogador não tiver lido essas regras, o Diretor e os demais podem explicá-las durante sua primeira Negociação.

Negociação é uma estrutura para interpretar encontros importantes onde os heróis querem convencer um NPC a tomar certas ações, como emprestar um Artefato aos heróis ou perdoar um prisioneiro. Esta estrutura monitora o Interesse do NPC nos argumentos do herói e sua Paciência, para que o Diretor saiba o que o NPC está disposto a oferecer e quando é hora de encerrar a cena. Esta estrutura não deve substituir a interpretação (embora certamente possa ajudar se seu grupo não gosta dessa parte em RPGs). A estrutura está aqui para ajudar jogadores e Diretores a entenderem os mecanismos do vai e vem de uma conversa, além de dar algumas regras que podem tornar uma conversa de alto risco ainda mais dramática!

## Quando Negociar

Para que uma Negociação ocorra, um NPC precisa ter interesse em negociar com os heróis - mas também razões para não simplesmente aceitar o que eles propõem. Negociações só ocorrem quando o NPC tem essa tensão interna entre interesse e relutância. Por exemplo, se os personagens pedem ao rei que envie seu exército para lutar contra uma invasão demoníaca num reino vizinho, o rei precisa estar dividido. Ele quer deter a invasão, mas também não quer arriscar a vida de seus soldados defendendo um reino estrangeiro, deixando os seus próprios súditos desprotegidos. Se os heróis quiserem a ajuda desse exército, eles terão que negociar.

Não se espera que os heróis usem essas regras toda vez que tentarem convencer um NPC. Por exemplo, se um herói quer que um cultista capturado dê informações sobre o líder do culto, um Teste de Presença usando Mentir ou um Teste de Músculo com Intimidar provavelmente bastam. Um personagem que quiser flertar com o alquimista local para conseguir uma Poção de Cura grátis provavelmente só precisa de um Teste de Presença com a Perícia Flertar resolve.

Por outro lado, Negociações normalmente envolvem todos os heróis interagindo com um ou mais NPCs importantes que podem oferecer informações, itens ou serviços capazes de mudar o rumo da aventura.  
Geralmente, isso envolve buscar um item de grande poder, um militante ou companheiro, os serviços de uma organização ou nação influente ou uma informação que cause uma reviravolta na trama. Convencer um Lich a emprestar o lendário _Codex Mortis_, persuadir um dragão a parar de atacar a torre de um mago ou convencer os generais de um exército inimigo a recuar significa que é hora de uma negociação.

Para negociar com sucesso, os heróis precisam apresentar argumentos persuasivos para convencer os NPCs. "Faça isso ou matamos você" é uma ameaça que pode acompanhar um Teste de Músculo com a Perícia Intimidar, mas não é uma tática de negociação.

### Limites da Negociação

Alguns jogadores podem achar que o sistema de Negociação deveria funcionar como uma espécie de controle mental. Eles não estão acostumados a ver NPCs como personagens complexos e podem tentar negociar em situações onde isso não faz sentido ou é literalmente impossível. Não importa quão eloquente um herói seja, nenhum argumento vai convencer o vil Lorde Syuul a abandonar o mal e virar jardineiro. Uma negociação tipicamente não pode convencer uma rainha a entregar sua coroa aos heróis e nomeá-los os novos governantes ou inspirar um dragão a entregar todo o seu tesouro. Negociações só funcionam quando os heróis pedem algo que o NPC está disposto a seriamente considerar dar a eles.

Negociação não é um processo que muda a personalidade de um NPC. Os heróis estão tentando fazer com que ele perceba que agir diferente ainda está dentro de seu caráter. Você pode ser capaz de fazer o até então leal tenente de um chefe maligno reconsiderar seus erros. É um clichê dramático clássico. Ainda assim, você não está mudando a personalidade dele - você está convencendo ele de que suas ações cruéis lhe cabem. "É isso quem você é? É assim que você quer ser lembrado?!"

Se alguns jogadores querem usar a Negociação como desculpa para que seus personagens digam "Faça o que mandamos, senão!", você pode lembrá-los de que não é assim que a maioria das pessoas, incluindo NPCs, funciona. Qualquer herói que comece com essa atitude provavelmente perderá a negociação antes mesmo que ela comece.

### A Ameaça de Violência

No mundo real, negociações raramente ocorrem com a ameaça de violência imediata. Embaixadores não costumam ir para as vias de fato. Mas este é um RPG de fantasia heroica, com heróis armados até os dentes e capazes de alterar a realidade com o poder da mente. A ameaça de violência já está implícita. Todos envolvidos sabem que os personagens podem sacar armas a qualquer momento.

O Diretor tipicamente assume que o potencial implícito para que a situação se torne violenta já está sendo considerado em qualquer Negociação. Entretanto, se os heróis quiserem tornar essa ameaça mais evidente, então eles saem do espaço da Negociação e entram em um tipo diferente de relacionamento - e provavelmente é hora de sacar armas.

Negociação é sobre persuadir alguém a ajudar você voluntariamente porque você convenceu ele de que alcançar seus objetivos é uma boa ideia. Colaborar com você é sábio ou óbvio ou pode fazê-lo parecer bem para outros. Um herói pode absolutamente ameaçar alguém com violência e forçá-lo a fazer o que quiser, mas estes é um estado incrivelmente temporário. Um NPC ameaçado não está fazendo o que foi pedido por vontade própria. Ele o está fazendo sobe ameaça de violência e irá agir de acordo apenas enquanto esta ameaça for evidente - depois disso, ele provavelmente voltará ao comportamento anterior assim que pensar que puder fazer isso.

## Atributos de Negociação

Durante a Negociação, o Diretor designa aos NPCs quatro atributos e recursos temporários - Interesse, Paciência, Motivações e Implicâncias. Os heróis pode conseguir um acordo favorável se maximizarem o Interesse de um NPC ao apresentarem argumentos que apelam a suas Motivações e evitam suas Implicâncias - mas precisam fazer tudo isso antes que a Paciência do NPC acabe.

### Interesse

O Interesse de um NPC representa o quão disposto ele está a fazer um acordo com os heróis. O Interesse é medido em uma escala de 0 (sem Interesse) a 5 (Interesse máximo). Quando uma Negociação começa, o Interesse de um NPC está entre 1 e 4. Se o Interesse do NPC chegar a 5, ele faz uma oferta final e a Negociação termina (veja Continuar ou Parar, abaixo). Se o Interesse cair para 0, ele encerra a Negociação sem oferecer nada aos heróis.

O Interesse aumenta ou diminui durante a Negociação, dependendo dos argumentos feitos pelos heróis.

### Paciência

A Paciência de um NPC representa quanto tempo e esforço ele está disposto a dedicar à Negociação. A Paciência é medida em uma escala de 0 a 5, com cada NPC começando a Negociação com Paciência maior que 0. Se a Paciência de um NPC chegar a 0, ele faz uma oferta final e a Negociação termina (veja Continuar ou Parar).

A Paciência pode diminuir a cada argumento feito pelos heróis durante a Negociação.

#### Idioma e Paciência

Se um ou mais heróis envolvidos na Negociação falarem o Idioma nativo do NPC (excluindo Caeliano), a Paciência do NPC aumenta em 1 no início da Negociação (até o máximo de 5). Se três ou mais heróis falam o Idioma nativo do NPC, a Paciência aumenta em 2 (até o máximo de 5). Capítulo 4: Antecedentes tem mais informações sobre alguns dos Idiomas do jogo.

### Motivações

Cada NPC possui pelo menos duas Motivações às quais os heróis podem apelar em seus argumentos. Argumentos que apelam a uma Motivação do NPC fazem um Lançamento de Poder mais fácil para aumentar o Interesse do NPC. Argumentos que não apelam a uma Motivação fazem um Lançamento de Poder mais difícil. Veja Fazendo Argumentos para mais informações.

Cada Motivação só pode ser utilizada com sucesso uma vez por Negociação. Para apelar com sucesso a uma Motivação, os heróis devem usá-la em um argumento sem mencionar uma Implicância do NPC ou serem pegos mentindo.

### Implicâncias

Implicâncias são Motivações que causam raiva, desconforto, vergonha, medo ou outras respostas negativas em um NPC. Usar uma Implicância em um argumento reduz o Interesse e a Paciência do NPC. Cada NPC tem pelo menos uma Implicância e muitos têm duas ou mais.

Implicâncias e Motivações são dois lados da mesma moeda. Elas são apresentadas abaixo como uma lista única, pois o que pode ser uma Motivação para um NPC pode ser uma Implicância para outro. Sempre que os heróis fazem um argumento, correm o risco de esbarrar em uma Implicância, a menos que tenham feito uma boa pesquisa ou saibam entender bem o NPC.

### Lista de Motivações e Implicâncias

Um NPC pode ter qualquer uma das doze Motivações ou Implicâncias a seguir.

#### Benevolência

Um NPC com Motivação de Benevolência acredita em compartilhar o que tem com os outros. No entanto, um NPC envolvido em uma Negociação precisa ter limites em sua Benevolência, para que não simplesmente dê aos heróis o que eles querem.

Às vezes a Benevolência de um NPC pode se estender apenas a um grupo específico de pessoas, como um capitão pirata benevolente que divide seu saque livremente com a tripulação - mas ainda assim está saqueando! Outras vezes, a caridade de um NPC pode ser limitada pelo fato de que ele não tem muito a oferecer. Um NPC benevolente pode hesitar em ajudar os heróis porque acredita que seus recursos limitados fariam mais diferença em outro lugar.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Benevolência tem uma visão cínica do mundo, acreditando que nenhuma criatura tem direito a nada apenas por estar viva. A ideia de ajudar os outros por ser a coisa certa a se fazer é absurda, imatura ou ingênua, algo a ser ridicularizado ou suprimido.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Benevolência defendem que, se o NPC fizer um acordo com os heróis, as pessoas de quem o NPC gosta sairão beneficiadas. Exemplos de argumentos incluem:

- “Se você nos emprestar a Espada de Agathor, podemos tornar Capital mais segura para sua guilda ao usá-la para derrotar seus inimigos.”
- “Se você nos teletransportar para a caverna do dragão, daremos metade do tesouro do monstro depois que cortarmos sua cabeça. Isso pode beneficiar gerações de alunos da sua academia!”

#### Descoberta

Um NPC com Motivação de Descoberta deseja aprender novos conhecimentos, explorar locais esquecidos, fazer descobertas por meio de experimentos ou encontrar artefatos perdidos ao tempo. Sua curiosidade e busca por conhecimento podem estar ligadas a um objetivo específico, como buscar a cura para uma doença rara ou encontrar um portal para um mundo distante. Ou pode ser que ele seja simplesmente uma pessoa naturalmente curiosa que quer entender tudo o que puder sobre a Timescape.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Descoberta não tem interesse em encontrar novos lugares, povos ou ideias. Pode ser que o desconhecido o assuste ou o deixe tão desconfortável que prefira permanecer ignorante. Outra opção é que uma busca anterior por descobertas pode ter acabado mal para ele.

Argumentos que apelam para a Motivação de Descoberta sustentam que fazer um acordo com os heróis permitirá ao NPC adquirir novos conhecimentos ou obter algo único. Exemplos incluem:

- “Permita que usemos seu cifrador para traduzir a única cópia do _Codex Mortis_ e depois deixaremos você ler o livro.”
- “Sabemos que a viagem até a Ilha Decant é perigosa, mas estamos indo para território inexplorado. Pensamos que sua tripulação de marinheiros gostaria de estar entre os poucos mortais a contemplar esse lugar.”

#### Liberdade

Um NPC com Motivação de Liberdade não quer autoridade acima de si e não deseja exercê-la sobre os outros. Pode ser que ele já possua liberdade pessoal e deseje manter esse status ou que deseje libertar a si mesmo e outros do domínio de terceiros.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Liberdade acredita que um mundo sem autoridade é um mundo em caos e desordem. Ele pode até acreditar que ele mesmo é a pessoa certa para governar e que seus ideais devem se tornar lei.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Liberdade sustentam que ajudar os heróis preservará ou concederá liberdade ao NPC ou a outras pessoas. Exemplos incluem:

- “Eu sei que você quer ver a autoridade da rainha revogada para sempre. Ela não tem herdeiros. Dê-nos a chave do escritório dela para que possamos provar sua corrupção e dar a você a chance de derrubar a monarquia.”
- “Se você prometer nos dar dez frascos de Beijo do Assassino, garantiremos que a prisão do barão seja esvaziada.”

#### Ganância

Um NPC com Motivação de Ganância deseja riqueza e recursos acima de quase tudo. Às vezes esses NPCs são avarentos, como dragões que acumulam moedas e joias, mas nunca as gastam ou doam. Outros ostentam sua riqueza, tratando-a como um sinal de seu status social.

NPCs gananciosos podem dividir sua riqueza com um grupo restrito de pessoas queridas, como um nobre que satisfaz todos os desejos dos filhos. Alguns NPCs podem desejar recursos diferentes de dinheiro, como um demônio que coleciona e devora almas ou um senhor troll que tem fome insaciável pela carne alheia.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Ganância não tem interesse em acumular riquezas ou recursos e se ofende se alguém tentar comprar sua cooperação. Ele valoriza seus ideais acima de desejos materiais.

Argumentos que apelam para a Motivação de Ganância sugerem que ajudar os heróis aumentará a riqueza ou os bens do NPC. Exemplos incluem:

- “Você deveria nos ajudar a combater o Supermente. A riqueza de Xorranox é lendária e faremos com que você receba sua parte justa.”
- “Nos dê uma semana para pesquisar sua coleção privada de livros e em troca daremos mais dez tomos únicos que encontramos em um antigo santuário de elfo estelar.”

#### Autoridade Superior

Um NPC com Motivação de Autoridade Superior é firmemente leal a uma pessoa ou força que considera mais importante do que ele próprio. Essa autoridade superior pode ser uma organização, uma divindade ou ser poderoso, um líder formal como um nobre ou monarca, uma presença mística ou força que o NPC não compreende totalmente, ou até alguém que o NPC considera uma figura de autoridade informal (como um irmão mais velho, um herói pessoal, etc.).

Um NPC com a Implicância de Autoridade Superior despreza a ideia de servir a outro. O NPC pode não acreditar que todos devem ser livres, mas certamente acredita que ele próprio não deve responder a ninguém.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Autoridade Superior afirmam que é do interesse dessa autoridade que o NPC faça um acordo com os heróis. Um herói pode até dizer que, se a autoridade estivesse na posição do NPC, ela faria o mesmo. Exemplos incluem:

- “Todas as grandes criações honram seu deus, Malus. Se você me ensinar a forjar o Martelo de Azdul, será uma grande honra para seu deus.”
- “Sabe o que Jarith, o Ousado, faria? Ele nos guiaria pelo imenso deserto até a torre. Você será nosso Jarith?”

#### Justiça

Um NPC com Motivação de Justiça quer ver os justos recompensados e os perversos punidos, por mais subjetiva que seja sua noção de bem e mal. Um sacerdote devoto de um deus da natureza pode acreditar que todos que protegem plantas e animais são justos, enquanto aqueles que exploram recursos naturais, como mineradores e lenhadores, devem morrer. Ter uma Motivação de Justiça não significa que o NPC seja bondoso ou caridoso.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Justiça não acredita que a Timescape seja um lugar inerentemente justo e não tem interesse em torná-lo isto. Para ele, o mundo é feito de conflito eterno, justiça não existe e quem acredita nisso é um tolo ingênuo.

Argumentos que apelam para a Motivação de Justiça colocam os heróis ao lado do que o NPC considera correto ou moral. Exemplos incluem:

- "Você despreza aqueles que roubam da natureza. Permita que entremos pacificamente em sua Silva para engarrafarmos a água abençoada da nascente. Vamos usá-la para impedir um exército de derrubar cada árvore e rasgar a terra por onde passa."
- "Você acha que nobres são barões preguiçosos que enriquecem às custas dos camponeses. Queremos destronar Lorde Saxton. Empreste-nos sua equipe de ladrões e garantiremos que, quando Saxton cair, o povo possa escolher seus próprios líderes."

#### Legado

Um NPC com Motivação de Legado deseja fama em vida e reconhecimento que perdure após a morte. Ele espera que outros conheçam e se lembrem de seus feitos, grandiosos ou terríveis. Alguns desses NPCs podem até buscar a imortalidade por meio da divinização ou da não-morte, para que o fim de sua forma mortal não os impeça de continuar fazendo história.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Legado não se importa em deixar uma marca pessoal no mundo. Para ele, esse tipo de vaidade é apenas uma perda de tempo.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Legado sustentam que fazer um acordo com os heróis aumenta as chances de que o povo fale sobre o NPC por séculos. Exemplos incluem:

- "Se você nos der o itinerário do grão-vizir, eu vou compor uma canção sobre sua coragem ao desafiá-lo e então cantá-la em todas as tavernas daqui até Ix!"
- "Sim, perder a batalha é uma possibilidade. Se isso acontecer, os gnolls ainda virão atrás de você eventualmente. Mas se esmagarmos nossos inimigos, imagine as homenagens, as histórias, os poemas, as estátuas — tudo isso criado para você porque suas máquinas de cerco viraram o jogo."

#### Paz

Um NPC com Motivação de Paz quer tranquilidade em sua vida. Em circunstâncias normais, ele deseja ser deixado em paz para cuidar de seus negócios, fazenda, reino, império criminoso ou qualquer pequeno pedaço da Timescape que lhe pertence. Alguns desses NPCs ainda não têm paz e precisam de ajuda para conquistá-la, enquanto outros desejam manter o status atual.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Paz odeia o tédio. Ele deseja emoção, drama e perigo em sua vida. Para ele, não há nada pior do que a mesmice.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Paz afirmam que ajudar os heróis trará alguma tranquilidade ao NPC, ao menos por um tempo. Exemplos incluem:

- "Você está indo bem aqui. Um pouco de roubo de nobres, contrabando de álcool e alguns cassinos ilegais. Ninguém está se machucando, mas o Oficial Cofax está se aproximando. Podemos redirecioná-lo para uma ameaça real à comunidade, se você nos ajudar a armar uma armadilha para o Relojoeiro."
- "Eu sei que você não vende para forasteiros, mas precisamos desse elmo. Vou usá-lo para repelir um grupo de hobgoblins que está vindo para cá. Eles não serão tão amigáveis quanto nós."

#### Poder

Um NPC com Motivação de Poder deseja a autoridade dos outros. Ele quer aumentar sua influência, por maior que ela já possa ser, e manter seu domínio. Pode buscar poder por meio da conquista, da coleta de artefatos ou de rituais sobrenaturais — embora por que escolher só um método quando combinar os três pode trazer os melhores resultados? Alguns desses NPCs são tiranos que cruzam mundos, mas até administradores mesquinhos de vilarejos e santuários podem cobiçar poder com igual intensidade.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Poder não tem interesse em autoridade para si. Ele pode até respeitar a autoridade de outros, mas odeia a ideia de governar sobre alguém e rejeita completamente qualquer sugestão disso.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Poder sustentam que trabalhar com os heróis aumentará ou protegerá o poder do NPC. Exemplos incluem:

- "Todo mundo sabe que você deveria comandar a guarda, Percy. A velha está se aposentando e nosso amigo Barão Kuglar vai escolher o substituto. Agora, se você nos deixar entrar no arsenal restrito, podemos falar bem de você para ele."
- "Sabemos que ele é seu irmão, Alteza, mas ele é o mais velho — o primeiro na linha do trono. Se nos ajudar a provar que ele faz parte de um culto, você se torna o filho favorito."

> **NPCs Mudam com o Tempo**
>
> Assim como os heróis, NPCs em Negociações são indivíduos complexos que podem mudar ao longo do tempo. É possível que os heróis precisem negociar com o mesmo NPC diversas vezes durante a Campanha e, com o passar do tempo, as Motivações e Implicâncias desse NPC podem mudar. Se os heróis transformarem um capitão bandido com Motivações de Ganância e Poder em um aliado temporário, esse criminoso pode aprender com eles, passando a roubar apenas de quem explora os pobres e distribuindo esses ganhos a quem precisa. Na próxima Negociação com esse capitão, suas Motivações podem ser Benevolência e Proteção.

#### Proteção

Um NPC com Motivação de Proteção tem terras, pessoas, informações, objetos ou uma organização que deseja proteger acima de tudo. Manter sua responsabilidade segura é um dever que leva muito a sério e quem ajuda nessa proteção conquista sua confiança. A maioria das pessoas tem amigos ou família que deseja proteger, mas um NPC com a Motivação de Proteção acredita em fazer isso a qualquer custo.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Proteção está feliz em deixar os outros se virarem sozinhos. Ele não acredita que seja sua responsabilidade proteger ninguém além de si mesmo e pode até sentir repulsa pela ideia de arriscar sua vida ou propriedades para proteger os outros.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Proteção afirmam que ajudar os heróis permitirá ao NPC proteger melhor aquilo que é importante para ele. Exemplos incluem:

- "Soldados mortos aumentam o exército da necromante. A aniquilação total é a única forma de derrotá-la. Marche conosco agora, enquanto o exército dela ainda é pequeno, e nós a derrotaremos. Ou você pode arriscar que alguém tente, fracasse e logo ela estará às suas portas com um exército dez vezes maior."
- "Vejo que seu neto está determinado a entrar no serviço militar. Acontece que tenho uma armadura mágica que pode ajudá-lo a resistir aos golpes de monstros e bandidos. Ficarei feliz em lhe dar a armadura, em troca de nos emprestar seus grifos por alguns dias. Afinal, não vou precisar dela se puder simplesmente voar sobre os monstros do pântano."

#### Folia

Um NPC com a Motivação de Folia só quer se divertir. Ele gosta de socializar em festas, buscar adrenalina ou se entregar a outras atividades hedonistas. Obter prazer da vida e passar tempo com pessoas de quem gosta é fundamental para esses NPCs.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Folia vê encontros sociais e hedonismo como perda de tempo. Eles só sentem prazer no trabalho ou no aperfeiçoamento de suas habilidades e caráter. Quem sugere devassidão imatura não merece seu tempo.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Folia afirmam que fazer um acordo com os heróis permitirá ao NPC voltar à diversão mais cedo, por mais tempo ou com mais intensidade. Exemplos incluem:

- "O que você acha de ter as músicas mais exclusivas para sua celebração de aniversário exclusiva na próxima semana? Posso compor uma lista de músicas totalmente originais, de graça... desde que você convide a mim e à minha banda para a festa."
- "Eu sei que você não quer forjar cinco Coroas Cronocinésicas. Que tal o seguinte: você faz isso por mim e eu lhe dou os quatorze barris de uísque que encontramos em uma ruína de Anões de Aço. Essa bebida é antiga, única e forte o bastante para lhe fazer esquecer o próprio nome. Você pode abrir um barril com seus amigos para comemorar o trabalho bem feito."

#### Vingança

Um NPC com a Motivação de Vingança quer ferir alguém que o feriu. Seu desejo de revanche pode ser proporcional ao dano sofrido ou pode querer retribuir com juros. Em alguns casos, o desejo de vingança só se realiza com a morte do inimigo, mas outros NPCs podem querer retribuir sua dor com humilhação, ruína profissional ou outro sofrimento menos permanente.

Um NPC com a Implicância de Vingança acredita que vingança não resolve nada. Ele pode ter aprendido isso na prática ou simplesmente não ter ambição para buscá-la — e tende a desprezar quem busca.

Argumentos que apelam à Motivação de Vingança afirmam que o NPC pode se vingar ajudando os heróis. Exemplos incluem:

- "Os servos de Ajax mataram sua irmã enquanto ela procurava pelos cultos dele na cidade. O Pacto do Ferro Preto serve ao Overlorde. Dê-nos os diários dela e talvez descubramos o esconderijo do pacto para desferir um grande golpe nos seus inimigos."
- "Aquele brincalhão do Huckable rasgou suas calças na última reunião do conselho. Você não quer se vingar? Podemos armar uma pegadinha deliciosa na próxima reunião, mas precisamos que você garanta a segurança dos Orcs refugiados."

## Começando uma Negociação

Uma Negociação começa quando os heróis pedem algo a um NPC e o Diretor decide que as circunstâncias exigem uma Negociação. Essas circunstâncias sempre envolvem os heróis precisando de ajuda que pode mudar o rumo da aventura e o NPC estando em dúvida sobre colaborar. Ao contrário do combate, que pode ser forçado por aliados violentos ou circunstâncias inesperadas, os heróis devem ser aqueles que iniciam uma Negociação voluntariamente. Personagens devem querer algo do NPC. Caso contrário, eles não têm motivo para negociar!

O Diretor pode decidir que um NPC com algo que os jogadores querem pode bater à porta e perguntar se os heróis querem negociar. Mas os personagens sempre podem dizer "Não estamos interessados" e recusar a Negociação.

### Parar Combate, Iniciar Negociação

Se um herói quiser interromper as hostilidades para negociar com o inimigo, pode usar uma Manobra para fazer um Teste Difícil de Presença (ou outro Teste aplicável, a critério do Diretor), tentando encerrar o combate e iniciar uma Negociação. O Teste só pode ter sucesso se o Diretor acreditar que o outro lado está disposto e é capaz de negociar. Um inimigo que está em vantagem, que odeia os heróis profundamente ou que não tem inteligência suficiente provavelmente não vai negociar.

### Atributos Iniciais

Os atributos iniciais de Negociação de um NPC dependem da atitude dele em relação aos heróis, conforme mostrado na tabela de Atitudes Iniciais de Negociação, e podem ser ajustados pelo Diretor como achar apropriado. Um NPC naturalmente irritadiço pode ter Paciência menor, enquanto um NPC hostil, mas com grande interesse no assunto da Negociação, pode ter um nível de Interesse acima do normal.

#### Atitudes Iniciais de Negociação

| Atitude     | Descrição                                                                                                       | Interesse | Paciência |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Hostil      | Aberta oposição aos heróis. Mal disposto a ouvir.                                                               | 1         | 2         |
| Desconfiado | Duvida das motivações dos heróis, mas está disposto a ouvir.                                                    | 2         | 2         |
| Neutro      | Não sente nada a favor ou contra. Provavelmente preferiria estar em outro lugar, mas não quer ser rude.         | 2         | 3         |
| Receptivo   | Disposto a ouvir e ajudar, desde que os heróis não peçam demais.                                                | 3         | 3         |
| Amigável    | Os heróis parecem pessoas agradáveis ao NPC. Ele está disposto a lhes dar o benefício da dúvida.                | 3         | 4         |
| Crédulo     | O NPC tem motivos para acreditar na palavra dos heróis e ajudará se os personagens não estragarem a Negociação. | 3         | 5         |

## Descobrindo Motivações

Se um herói deseja descobrir as Motivações de um NPC, ele pode começar simplesmente perguntando “O que você quer com esse acordo?” Em resposta, o NPC pode voluntariamente dar pistas ou revelar uma de suas Motivações, geralmente pedindo algo em troca. Por exemplo, um monarca NPC com a Motivação de Ganância e gosto por colecionar animais raros pode sugerir que os heróis recuperarem um ovo de grifo lhes garantirá a gratidão do monarca. O Diretor também pode decidir que, durante o curso natural da Negociação, o NPC pode oferecer sugestões semelhantes sem que os heróis peçam, desde que o NPC já tenha um Interesse de 3 ou mais.

Se um NPC não for tão aberto ou se os heróis quiserem aprender uma das Implicâncias do NPC, um herói pode fazer um Teste de Razão, Intuição ou Presença enquanto interage com o NPC durante a Negociação, baseado nas táticas usadas para extrair informações do NPC. O Teste tem os seguintes resultados:

**Lançamento de Poder + Razão, Intuição ou Presença**

- **≤11:** O herói não aprende nenhuma informação sobre as Motivações ou Implicâncias do NP, e o NPC percebe que o herói está tentando lê-lo, ficando irritado. Como consequência, a Paciência do NPC diminui em 1.
- **12-16:** O herói não aprende nenhuma informação sobre as Motivações ou Implicâncias do NPC.
- **17+:** O herói aprende uma das Motivações ou Implicâncias do NPC (escolha do herói).

Depois desse Teste, os heróis não podem fazer outro Teste para determinar as Motivações ou Implicâncias do mesmo NPC até que façam um argumento para o NPC ou a Negociação termine.

### Fora da Negociação

Enquanto os heróis podem descobrir as Motivações ou Implicâncias de um NPC por Testes durante a Negociação, eles podem usar outros métodos de investigação antes dela. Pesquisas ou um pouco de reconhecimento (por exemplo, ler o diário do NPC ou conversar com seus amigos mais próximos) podem revelar bastante sobre uma pessoa!

## Fazendo Argumentos

Como parte do pedido inicial a um NPC em uma Negociação, um herói faz um argumento para justificar por que o NPC deveria conceder o que eles querem. O herói pode oferecer algo em troca, como eliminar bandidos da floresta, entregar um tesouro ou matar um dragão para o NPC. Ou, em vez de oferecer algo, o herói pode tentar convencer o NPC de que ajudar é do próprio interesse dele — ou até mesmo uma obrigação moral. Por exemplo, um herói pode apelar ao senso de dever de um cavaleiro, à riqueza potencial que um mercenário pode ganhar ou ao último desejo da avó falecida de uma rainha como parte do argumento. NPCs que admiram os heróis tendem a responder melhor a elogios, enquanto aqueles que os temem respondem mais a intimidação e espanto.

Argumentos precisam de uma justificativa que explique o porquê são verdadeiros. “Ajudar-nos a derrotar o Lorde Saxton é bom para você no longo prazo” é metade de um argumento e o herói também deve explicar o motivo: “Ajudar-nos a derrotar Lorde Saxton é bom para você porque sabemos que ele vai atacar seu reino depois que Bedegar cair!” Se o herói fizer só metade do argumento, o NPC pode perguntar “Por que você diz isso?” ou “O que faz você pensar que isso é verdade?” para que o herói faça um argumento completo.

Um herói faz o argumento para o NPC, mas os jogadores podem discutir os detalhes do argumento fora de personagem de antemão. O grupo decide o quanto discutir antes de fazer um argumento que os jogadores acreditam que melhor convencerá o NPC.

Esse é um bom tema para discussão antes do grupo começar uma Negociação, para que todos saibam o que os outros pensam. Alguns grupos se divertem mais sem essa discussão, enquanto outros preferem planejar o máximo possível.

### Apelar à Motivação

Se um argumento não incluir uma Implicância e apelar a uma das Motivações do NPC que ainda não foi usada, o herói pode fazer um Teste Fácil para tentar convencer o NPC com esse argumento. Dependendo do argumento, pode ser um Teste de Razão, Intuição ou Presença usando qualquer Perícia aplicável — geralmente uma Perícia do Grupo de Perícias Interpessoais. O Teste tem os seguintes resultados:

**Lançamento de Poder + Razão, Intuição ou Presença**

- **≤11:** A Paciência do NPC diminui em 1 ponto.
- **12-16:** O Interesse do NPC aumenta em 1 ponto e sua Paciência diminui em 1 ponto.
- **17+:** O Interesse do NPC aumenta em 1 ponto e sua Paciência não muda.

A critério do Diretor, um argumento muito bem interpretado ou fundamentado pode contar automaticamente como um resultado de Grau 3 sem fazer um Teste. Boa interpretação deve ser recompensada!

Se os heróis tentarem apelar a uma Motivação já usada, o Interesse do NPC permanece igual e a Paciência diminui em 1 ponto.

> **Apelando a Múltiplas Motivações**
>
> Se um herói fizer um argumento que pareça apelar a várias Motivações de um NPC, o Diretor pode pedir esclarecimentos. Depois de listar as Motivações que parecem ter sido usadas, ele pode pedir que o jogador escolha uma da lista. Se o jogador tinha outra Motivação em mente, cabe ao Diretor decidir se o argumento apela a ela ou não.

### Sem Motivação ou Implicância

Se um argumento não incluir nenhuma Motivação ou Implicância do NPC, o herói deve fazer um Teste mais difícil para convencer o NPC. O Teste tem os seguintes resultados:

**Lançamento de Poder + Razão, Intuição ou Presença**

- **≤11:** A Paciência do NPC diminui em 1 ponto e seu Interesse diminui em 1 ponto.
- **12-16:** A Paciência do NPC diminui em 1 ponto.
- **17+:** O Interesse do NPC aumenta em 1 ponto e sua Paciência diminui em 1 ponto.

Se os heróis tentarem usar o mesmo argumento sem Motivação ou Implicância duas vezes, o Teste é automaticamente um resultado de Grau 1.

### Pego Mentindo

Se um herói mentir para um NPC com um argumento que não aumente o Interesse do NPC, o Diretor pode decidir que o NPC percebe a mentira e se ofende. O Interesse do NPC diminui em 1, além de qualquer diminuição causada pelo fracasso.

> **Todos Podem Participar**
>
> Como Razão e Intuição podem ser usados com Perícias aplicadas criativamente para fazer argumentos, todos os heróis podem participar ativamente da Negociação. O herói com maior Presença e a Perícia Persuadir não precisa fazer todos os Testes.

### Implicância Usada

Se um argumento usar uma Implicância do NPC, ele falha automaticamente e o Interesse e a Paciência do NPC diminuem em 1 ponto cada. O NPC pode avisar os heróis para não agirem assim novamente.

### Renome e Negociação

Renome determina se a fama (ou infâmia) de um herói tem qualquer influência sobre um NPC. A reputação de um herói pode tornar a Negociação mais fácil, desde que o herói saiba como usar isso.

Durante a Negociação, o NPC tem uma pontuação de Opinião que determina quanto Renome é necessário para influenciá-lo (veja Renome no Capítulo 13: Recompensas). Essa pontuação só importa se o NPC conhece os heróis. Um dragão que dormiu por cem anos e acabou de ser acordado para negociar não pode ser influenciado pelo Renome de um herói. (Aliás, acordar um dragão é uma péssima ideia, mesmo que ele saiba que você é famoso.) Se o NPC conhece o herói e sua Opinião é igual ou menor que o Renome do herói, ele pode ser influenciado pela reputação do herói.

Quanto maior a Opinião do NPC, mais difícil é influenciá-lo com Renome. Um bandido pequeno tem uma pontuação de Opinião menor do que um monarca que se reúne com pessoas poderosas e famosas o tempo todo. A tabela de NPCs e Opinião fornece exemplos de pontuações típicas de Opinião de NPCs. Se uma criatura tiver um Nível, sua Opinião é igual ao Nível, a menos que o Diretor decida o contrário.

#### Fama ou Infâmia?

Se um herói tem Renome suficiente para influenciar um NPC durante a Negociação, o Diretor decide se ele é famoso ou infame para o NPC. Se o NPC aprecia as ações do personagem e o vê como um herói que torna o mundo melhor, esse herói é famoso para ele. Se o NPC acredita que as realizações do herói pioram o mundo e o vê como inimigo, o herói é infame para o NPC.

#### Influenciando Testes

Se um herói é famoso para um NPC, ele ganha uma Vantagem em Testes ao fazer argumentos que possam usar as Perícias Flertar, Liderar ou Persuadir. Se ele for infame para o NPC, ganha Vantagem em Testes para argumentos que usem as Perícias Gabar-se, Interrogar ou Intimidar. O herói ganha essa Vantagem mesmo sem possuir a Perícia adequada.

## Resposta e Oferta do NPC

Após o herói fazer um argumento, o NPC responde em uma de três maneiras:

- Positivamente, se o Interesse do NPC aumentar. “Ótimo ponto.” “Você me deu muito o que pensar.” “Justo.” “Faz sentido para mim.”
- Negativamente, se o Interesse diminuir. “Não acredito nisso.” “Besteira!” “Entendo, mas discordo.” “Isso não me convence.”
- Com impaciência, se o Interesse não mudar. “Já ouvi isso antes.” “Vai me oferecer algo de verdade?” “Essa discussão é cansativa.” “CHATO!”

A menos que o NPC seja enganador, deve ficar claro para os heróis se o argumento funcionou, se precisam tentar outro ou se a situação piorou.

A resposta inicial deve vir acompanhada de uma oferta (ou recusa em fazer uma oferta) baseada no Interesse atual do NPC. Se o argumento de um herói fizer a Paciência do NPC ir a zero, o NPC avisa que esta é sua oferta final.

### Interesse 5 (“Sim e ...”)

Se o Interesse do NPC for 5, ele oferece tudo o que os heróis pediram — e ainda melhora o acordo. Esse é o melhor resultado possível para os heróis. Se eles ofereceram serviços ou pagamentos, o NPC pode dispensá-los disso, deixando os heróis obterem tudo de graça. Ou ele pode exigir que os heróis cumpram suas promessas e ainda ofereça algo extra.

Por exemplo, se os heróis pediram ajuda de um chefe de guilda de ladrões contra Lorde Saxton, o chefe pode prometer enviar assassinos de elite para a batalha contra o nobre tirano e ainda dar uma aljava com flechas explosivas para dar vantagem na luta.

O NPC deve avisar que essa é a melhor oferta possível.

### Interesse 4 (“Sim.”)

Se o Interesse do NPC for 4, o NPC oferece tudo o que pediram, mas sem melhorias. O NPC também aceita tudo que os heróis ofereceram como parte do acordo.

Por exemplo, se os heróis oferecem libertar um ladrão da prisão em troca dos assassinos da guilda dos ladrões contra Lorde Saxton, o chefe da guilda aceita os termos sem ajustes. A Negociação provavelmente termina aqui, mas os heróis podem tentar pedir mais se o NPC ainda tiver Paciência para outros argumentos. O Diretor pode incentivar isso com perguntas como “Há mais alguma coisa?” ou “O que mais deseja de mim?”

### Interesse 3 (“Sim, mas ...”)

Se o Interesse do NPC for 3, ele oferece o que os heróis querem em troca do que ofereceram...e então pede algo a mais, como um favor ou pagamento extra. Por exemplo, se os heróis oferecem libertar um membro da guilda dos ladrões que está aprisionado em troca dos assassinos da organização, o chefe da guilda pode pedir que libertem mais um prisioneiro ou que ofereçam dinheiro ou uma arma mágica ao prisioneiro salvo.

### Interesse 2 (“Não, mas ...”)

Se o Interesse do NPC for 2, ele não pode dar o que os heróis querem, mas oferece outros bens ou serviços menos valiosos em troca do que prometeram. Por exemplo, o chefe da guilda dos ladrões pode não estar disposto a mandar tropas contra Saxton, mas oferece relatórios de espionagem sobre Lorde Saxton em troca da libertação de um prisioneiro.

### Interesse 1 (“Não.”)

Se o Interesse do NPC for 1, ele rejeita a ideia sem contraoferta. Se ainda tiver Paciência, pode tentar convencer os heróis a melhorarem a proposta, dizendo algo como “Por que arriscaríamos nossas vidas para ajudar a lutar contra Lorde Saxton? O que a guilda realmente ganharia, além de um fim rápido e brutal quando vocês falharem?”

### Interesse 0 (“Não e ...”)

Se o Interesse do NPC é 0, ele não oferece nada, recusa-se continuar a Negociação e busca prejudicar os heróis. O NPC pode atacar imediatamente ou adotar outra abordagem, como espalhar boatos maliciosos sobre os personagens, enviar assassinos atrás deles ou tornar suas vidas difíceis. Se os heróis não quiserem estar em conflito com o NPC, precisarão oferecer um presente valioso ou cumprir uma missão para fazer as pazes.

É impossível continuar a Negociação quando o Interesse do NPC chega a 0.

## Continuar ou Parar

Se o NPC ainda tiver Paciência após fazer uma oferta e o Interesse está entre 1 e 4, os heróis podem fazer outro argumento para tentar melhorar o acordo. Ou podem aceitar a oferta e encerrar a Negociação. Deixe os jogadores decidirem isso. Você pode sempre indicar que o NPC ainda tem Paciência fazendo perguntas como “Há mais alguma coisa?”

Se a Paciência do NPC for 0 ou o Interesse for 5, a oferta feita é a última do NPC para os personagens. Os heróis podem aceitar ou não, mas a Negociação termina.

Se o Interesse do NPC for 0, ele encerra a Negociação sem aceitar acordo. Os heróis podem abandonar uma Negociação sem aceitar acordo a qualquer momento.

## Exemplo de Negociação

Depois de matar o verdadeiro senhor de Bedegar, o tirano Lorde Saxton tomou a capital da baronia e está reunindo forças para marchar sobre os outros assentamentos de Bedegar. Os heróis recentemente salvaram Edmund, o legítimo herdeiro do trono de Bedegar, e agora reúnem forças para formar um exército capaz de enfrentar Saxton e derrotar o tirano.

Os heróis estão negociando com Zola Honeycut, uma Humana chefe de guilda do Relógio — uma guilda de ladrões cuja sede fica na capital de Bedegar. A guilda se opôs abertamente a Saxton quando ele tomou o poder, mas o tirano rapidamente reprimiu todos os membros conhecidos do Relógio, forçando-os a se esconder ou enforcando-os como aviso aos outros. Os heróis esperam convencer Zola a apoiar sua resistência armada.

### Atributos de Negociação de Zola

Zola é neutra com os heróis no início da Negociação. Conhece-os só pela reputação, mas sabe que eles também acreditam que Saxton é um tirano que deve ser detido. Contudo, enfrentar esse tirano custou caro ao povo dela e ela não tem certeza se está pronta para voltar à luta. Um passo em falso pode significar o fim do Relógio!

> **Atributos de Negociação de Zola Honeycut**
>
> **Interesse**: 2 • **Paciência**: 3 • **Opinião**: 3
>
> **Motivações**
>
> - **Benevolência**: O nome de Zola, Honeycut, vem do fato de que ela sempre dá a seus companheiros uma parte maior do que a própria pelos trabalhos.
> - **Proteção**: Os membros do Relógio são a única família que Zola já teve. O lema da guilda é “O Relógio está sempre correndo”, pois estão sempre planejando o próximo golpe e seu futuro cada vez mais próspero. Zola não quer ser a última líder da guilda.
>
> **Implicâncias**
>
> - **Autoridade Superior**: Zola não quer servir a ninguém além de si mesma e despreza a ideia de receber ordens.
> - **Folia**: Zola é focada nos negócios e não tem tempo para frivolidades, especialmente sob a ameaça de Saxton.

### Interpretando Zola

Zola está feliz de que finalmente alguém está enfrentando Lorde Saxton, mas irritada que ninguém se revoltou juntamente do Relógio meses atrás, quando o tirano deu o golpe. Ela é passional sobre proteger seu povo, rápida para acusar planos perigosos em argumentos que não lhe agradam e rápida para elogiar argumentos com os quais concorda. Ela não tem receio de ser franca com os heróis, sabendo que eles compartilham o desejo de ver Saxton derrotado. Ela só não sabe se pode arriscar mais de sua família encontrada na luta atual.

### Negociação em Ação

Aqui está como a Negociação com Zola pode se desenrolar.

**Diretor (Djordi)**: As janelas estão tapadas, impedindo a entrada de luz na taverna Olho de Bode, aparentemente abandonada. O local cheira a madeira queimada, prova do incêndio que consumiu grande parte do interior há três anos. Quando a porta se fecha atrás de vocês, a luz de uma lanterna no outro lado do bar repentinamente preenche a sala. Entre as paredes e pilares enegrecidos, seis brutamontes cercam seu grupo. A Humana com a lanterna sorri. “Bem-vindos. Sou Zola. Willoughby me avisou que vocês viriam. Sentem-se.” Ela indica algumas caixas arranjadas em círculo ao redor de um barril largo.

**James (como Korvo, um Sombra)**: Sento-me e digo, “Korvo ao seu dispor, Sra. Honeycut. Estes são os melhores companheiros que um Polder poderia querer: Linn, Jorn e Val.”

**Diretor**: Zola acena para cada um, depois diz, “Perdão, mas vou direto ao ponto. Hoje em dia, não há lugar seguro para o Relógio. Estamos sempre em movimento. Então me digam, o que querem aqui?”

**Diretor:** Zola nods to each of you in Turno, then says, “You’ll excuse me
if I dispense with more pleasantries. These days, no place is safe for the
O Relógio. We keep moving. So tell me, what are you here for?”

**Alyssa (como Jorn, um Tático)**: “Estamos formando um exército para derrubar Saxton de uma vez por todas.”

Neste cenário, todos os heróis têm Renome de 2, exceto por Jorn, que tem Renome de 3, e é famoso para Zola.

**Diretor**: Zola ri sem humor e balança a cabeça. “Ah é só isso? Tenho que dizer, não acho que vocês quatro tenham muita chance. A menos que estejam escondendo uma legião ou duas de Anões nos bolsos. Sim, vocês têm Jorn, o Poderoso, mas precisarão de mais do que um guerreiro famoso para vencer.”

**Alyssa**: Ah! Então ela ao menos ouviu falar de mim! Obrigada, Renome.

**Grace (como Val, uma Conduíta)**: “Não temos. Mas temos Lorde Edmund — o verdadeiro herdeiro do trono de Bedegar.”

**Diretor**: Zola acena, impressionada. “Fico feliz que o garoto esteja seguro, mas ele é só isso - um garoto, não um exército.”

**Matt (como Linn, uma Talento)**: “Ele é um garoto ao redor do qual as pessoas vão se unir. Não temos exército, mas é por isso que estamos aqui. Queremos mudar isso. Pode ceder alguns soldados para nossa causa?”

A Negociação começa oficialmente. Os heróis disseram o que querem de Zola. O Diretor os convida a fazer um argumento.

**Diretor**: Zola se reclina sobre a caixa. “É isso aí. O Relógio sacrificou muito contra Saxton. Por que arriscar mais para ajudar? Ninguém esteve aqui por nós meses atrás, quando enfrentamos a tirania.”

**Alyssa**: Assinto enquanto Zola fala, ouvindo antes de responder, “Não soubemos da sua luta até que Saxton já tivesse enforcado muitos dos seus bravos. Estamos aqui agora. Como podemos ajudar?”

Antes de argumentar, Jorn tenta descobrir as Motivações de Zola perguntando diretamente. O Diretor decide revelar uma Motivação: Proteção.

**Diretor**: “Se eu fosse fazer um acordo com vocês, e isso é um grande ‘se’, precisaria de garantias de que vocês podem acabar com isso. Provas seriam melhores ainda. A proteção do meu povo é minha prioridade. Podemos conquistar a liberdade de Saxton assim que recuperarmos força.”

**James**: Ahá! Eu cuido disso. Subo na caixa e digo, “Podemos oferecer isso, Sra. Honeycut. Convencemos Lorde Edmund a conceder anistia a quem jurar servir-lhe.” Quero fazer um Teste de Presença para convencê-la.

**Diretor**: Espere aí, campeão. Os olhos de Zola estreitam enquanto você fala, e ela levanta a mão para interromper. “Não jurarei servir a nenhum governante, por mais benevolente que seja. Posso considerar parceria, mas até isso parece precário se você me pedir para me curvar de novo.”

Korvo inadvertidamente fez um argumento que usou uma Implicância, apelando a uma Autoridade Superior. O Diretor nota que o Interesse de Zola caiu para 1 e a Paciência para 2. Ela deu uma resposta firme de “Não”, condizente com Interesse 1, mas o Diretor formulou de modo que os heróis sabem que ainda podem tentar novos argumentos, pois a Paciência dela não acabou.

**James**: Foi mal! Achei que ia funcionar. Parece que Autoridade Superior é uma Implicância para ela.

**Grace**: Vamos tentar evitar outras Implicâncias. Val diz, “Desculpe, Zola. Não queremos lhe ofender mais.” Quero fazer um Teste de Intuição e usar a Perícia Ler Pessoas para avaliar a reação dela e tentar perceber outras Implicâncias.

**Diretor:** Legal. Dificuldade Difícil.

**Grace:** Tirei 17! Sucesso.

**Diretor:** Zola se recosta, dando uma risadinha. “Tem duas coisas que eu não suporto — qualquer um me mandando beijar um anel e aqueles tolos festeiros que preferem sair para beber do que lutar pela própria liberdade. Felizmente, vocês não são desses.” Dá para perceber que festas também não são bem-vindas por Zola.

Os heróis agora conhecem as duas Implicâncias de Zola: Autoridade Superior e Folia.

**Matt:** Linn vai dizer: “Estamos recrutando mais do que só o Relógio. Temos uma boa chance de recrutar os Elfos Silvestres e os Orcs da Floresta Rend. Também estamos treinando o povo de Valcovas para resistir. Se atacarmos antes que Saxton termine de montar suas forças, todos teremos uma chance maior de sobrevivência. Se você não ficar do nosso lado, Saxton ainda virá atrás de você. Ele já está vindo. O Relógio tem menos chances sozinho.”

**Diretor:** Acho que isso é um Teste de Razão, já que você está usando lógica para mostrar que juntos têm mais chance do que separados. É um Teste Fácil, pois está apelando para uma das Motivações dela.

**Matt:** Ótimo! Posso usar Liderança aqui, já que estou mostrando nossa capacidade de unir pessoas?\_

**Diretor:** Pode.

**Matt:** Tirei 14!

Como Linn apelou para uma Motivação, o Interesse de Zola aumenta para 2 e sua Paciência permanece em 2. O Diretor dá uma resposta “Não, mas...” baseada no Interesse de Zola. Nesse ponto, os heróis ainda não prometeram nada, então ela oferece algo de graça.

**Diretor:** Zola acena com a cabeça enquanto você fala. “Você está certa, mas não tenho certeza se tenho o pessoal para isso. Vou dizer o que posso fazer. Ainda tenho espiões vigiando Saxton. Posso lhes dar informações sobre os movimentos das tropas dele. Isso serve?”

O Diretor deixa claro na resposta de Zola que a Negociação ainda pode continuar, se os jogadores quiserem.

**Alyssa:** Acho que não, né?

**James:** Não. Precisamos de um exército.

**Matt:** Sim, vamos insistir.

**Grace:** Concordo.

**Alyssa:** Será que conseguimos descobrir outra Motivação dela?

**James:** Tem algo que eu saiba sobre a reputação da Zola? Eu tenho a Perícia de Criminalidade.

**Diretor:** Faça um Teste de Razão.

**James:** Tirei 18! Sucesso!

**Diretor:** Korvo saberia que Zola ganhou o nome Honeycut porque ela é generosa com os ganhos da guilda. Ela dá uma boa parte para todos os seus comparsas em cada trabalho.

O sucesso de Korvo revelou a Motivação de Benevolência da Zola.

**James:** Brilhante! Acho que eu teria compartilhado isso com o grupo antes da negociação.

**Diretor:** Sim, faz sentido.

**Alyssa:** Ótimo. Jorn vai dizer “Seria vantajoso de outras formas para sua equipe se vocês se juntassem ao nosso lado.”

**Diretor:** O interesse de Zola é despertado. “O que faz você dizer isso?”

**Alyssa:** “Mesmo antes do golpe, Saxton já tinha uma boa quantidade de riqueza. Se ele for deposto, essas riquezas precisam ir para algum lugar. O Relógio vai receber uma parte — uma parte bem doce, por assim dizer. Edmund também prometeu dividir a fortuna da família com qualquer um que fique com ele contra Saxton - sem juras de lealdade. Depois que o jovem senhor recuperar o trono, claro.”

**Diretor:** Você está apelando para uma das Motivações dela, então faça um Teste de Presença.

**Alyssa:** Posso usar minha Perícia em Persuadir também?

**Diretor:** Com certeza. E você ganha uma Vantagem porque é famoso para ela.

**Alyssa:** Eu precisava dessa Vantagem. Tirei 12!

Como Jorn apelou para uma Motivação, o Interesse de Zola aumenta para 3 e sua Paciência diminui para 1. O Diretor dá uma resposta “Sim, mas...” deixando claro que a Negociação ainda pode continuar.

**Diretor:** Zola pensa por um momento. Ela acena com a cabeça, “Estou começando a ver os benefícios. Acho que posso escolher algumas pessoas para ajudar vocês, mas vocês têm que ajudar eles primeiro. Veja, meus melhores guerreiros estão presos na Fortaleza de Bedegar. Eles devem ser enforcados daqui a dois dias. Se vocês os libertarem, eu vou garantir que eles fiquem ao lado de vocês contra Saxton. Estávamos fazendo um plano para libertá-los sozinhos, mas, francamente, precisamos de ajuda.”

**Grace:** Poderíamos pressionar o Relógio para fazer isso por conta própria, mas não consigo imaginar Val virando as costas para quem precisa.

**James:** Concordo totalmente. Vou parar de forçar a sorte aqui.

**Matt:** Isso significa menos tempo para recrutar outras tropas, então é melhor agirmos rápido.

**Alyssa:** Então estamos de acordo. Estendo a mão para Zola. “Fechado.”

Os heróis poderiam ter tentado conseguir um acordo melhor, mas estão satisfeitos com a oferta de Zola, então aceitam os termos dela. A Negociação acaba.

# **Projetos de Tempo Livre**

```
s a team, you and your fellow heroes can achieve great things.
But the time between adventures gives you a chance to pursue
your own individual goals: uncover forbidden lore in ancient
tomes, forge weapons of great Poder, build ships that can sail the skies,
and more. Draw Steel ’s rules for downtime projects allow heroes to use
their time during respites to obtain important information, make new
Equipamento, and engage in other activities to Suporte their Aventurando.
```

Tracking Projects

```
You start a Projeto de Tempo Livre during a Descanso. You can start as many
projects as you like, but you can’t work on more than um project at a
time during a Descanso. Eventually, you’ll be able to hire criaturas who
can work on additional downtime projects for you.
You Rastrear project progress on your personagem sheet. As you work on a
Projeto de Tempo Livre, you Músculo look over old books that you’ve found in
your travels, perform experiments, converse with experts and scholars,
or work with tools to create something.
```

Project Prerequisites

```
All downtime projects have prerequisites you must meet before you
can undertake them.
```

```
Item Pré-requisito
Many downtime projects have um or more Especial items you must
possess or obtain before you can start the project. For instance, you
can’t build an airship without first finding a Wind Crystal of Quintes-
sence, a rare and key component in that vehicle’s construction. Other
projects have a Pré-requisito that involves undertaking certain activities
during the project process.
```

**Origem do Projeto**

```
To start a Projeto de Tempo Livre, you must have access to specific lore
detailing how the project is to be undertaken. This can take the form of
written information (a book, scroll, schematic, and so forth), an expert
tutor with wisdom to share, a master Artesão with skills to teach, a
Sobrenatural manifestation of the project’s scope and secrets, or qualquer
other form of the Diretor’s Determinação. This project-focused lore
is referred to as a Origem do Projeto. Not only do you need project sources
to start a Projeto de Tempo Livre, but you must have access to those sources
whenever you make a Lançamento de Projeto for that particular project (see
Lançamento de Projeto below).
Some project sources are relatively easy to find. Building a castle doesn’t
require tomes filled with ancient lore, but it’s also not something
every stonemason knows how to do. However, the location of the
Tumba de Ashrya, the mummified protector of um hundred slumbering
```

```
sorcerer-sovereigns, Músculo exist only in a single tome that requires an
accompanying adventure to unearth.
```

```
The idioma with which project sources are set down or can be shared
is chosen by the Diretor. The sample projects below have suggestions
using languages in Orden (see that section in Chapter 4: Antecedentes),
though you Músculo be able to find a version of a source in other
languages as well.
Whenever the Diretor determines that a criatura with needed
Conhecimento can be used as a Origem do Projeto, another Herói can serve as
this source of Conhecimento. However, they must use a Descanso activity
to be your Origem do Projeto whenever you make a Lançamento de Projeto related to
the project.
```

```
Procurar for Common Project Sources
If you need a Origem do Projeto for a particular project, ask your Diretor if
the source is common enough that it Músculo be found in a substantial
library, among a group of sages or guild artisans, and so forth. If the
Diretor says yes, then the next time you take a Descanso in a place with
a library or access to criaturas with the Conhecimento you seek, you can
locate the Origem do Projeto you need as a Descanso activity.
```

Lançamento de Projeto

```
As a Descanso activity (see Descanso in Chapter 1: The Basics), you make a
Lançamento de Projeto for um of your own projects. Alternatively, you can make a
Lançamento de Projeto to contribute to another Herói's project. A Lançamento de Projeto is a Teste
with a Especial outcome that isn’t divided into tiers. The characteristic
used in the Teste is determined by the project.
When you make a Lançamento de Projeto, the total—no matter how low—becomes
project points that are accrued by the project. Even if you have a
Penalidade on a Lançamento de Projeto, the minimum total for the roll is 1. If you
obtain a critical Sucesso—a natural 19 or 20—on a Lançamento de Projeto, this is
called a Avanço , and you can make another Lançamento de Projeto for the
same project as part of the same Descanso activity.
```

```
A Projeto de Tempo Livre is complete when it accrues project points equal
to or greater than its Objetivo de Projeto —the number of points it takes to
complete the project, noted in each project’s description.
As you work on a Projeto de Tempo Livre, the Diretor can add events that
help form the narrative of your research, crafting, or other activities.
These events Músculo provide unexpected benefits or challenges as you
work on your project, to help make the journey as dramatic as arriving
at the destination. See For the Diretor: Project Events below for more
information.
```

```
Lançamento de Projeto Edges and Banes
Since project rolls don’t use Sucesso tiers, they don’t follow the usual
rules for double edges and double banes. If you gain an Vantagem on a
Lançamento de Projeto, you add 2 to the roll, as usual. But if you have a double Vantagem,
you add 4 to the roll. Likewise, you subtract 2 from a Lançamento de Projeto that
takes a Desvantagem, and you subtract 4 from a roll that has a double Desvantagem.
```

**Skills and Project Rolls**

```
You can apply skills from either the crafting or lore Perícia groups to
project rolls that directly relate to a Projeto de Tempo Livre (see Skills in
Chapter 9: Tests). For example, you could use the Alfaiataria Perícia for
project rolls related to making a Magia Capuz, and you could use the
História Perícia while attempting to research the location of an ancient
battle where a Magia crown was lost. At the Diretor’s discretion, you
can also use skills from other Perícia groups, but a Perícia used for a project
roll must be directly related to the project.
```

```
idioma and Project Rolls
If you know the idioma of a Origem do Projeto, you can make a project
roll without qualquer issues. If you don’t know the idioma of the source
but you know a related idioma, the Lançamento de Projeto takes a Desvantagem. If you
don’t know the source’s idioma or a related idioma, the Lançamento de Projeto
has a double Desvantagem.
```

**Guides**

```
Heroes sometimes find guides—Especial books, schematics, Conhecimento-
able NPCs, Sobrenatural recordings, and so forth—providing important
and easy-to-understand information relating to a Projeto de Tempo Livre.
Each Guia has a Conhecimento value and a connection to a specific project
```

```
that greatly decreases the time required to complete the project.
When a Herói studies a Guia as a Descanso activity, they gain the Guia’s
Conhecimento value as project points toward its project. The Guia can’t
be used with that specific instance of the project De Novo, though it can be
used for a different project of the same Tipo.
```

```
Guides are awarded at the Diretor’s discretion, usually as a tool that
can be used to increase the Velocidade of complex projects for campaigns
with little downtime. For example, the Build Airship Projeto de Tempo Livre
has a Objetivo de Projeto of 3,000, requiring a fair bit of downtime. But if a
Herói finds a manual that describes how to craft an airship and grants
them 1,000 or more project points toward the Build Airship project, the
crafting time can be significantly reduced.
A Guia must provide its information in a idioma you understand for
you to gain its full Benefício. If a Guia uses a idioma related to um you
know, you gain only half the Guia’s Conhecimento value (rounded down)
as project points toward your project.
```

**For the Diretor: Project Events**

```
Project events are story events that present boons and challenges to
heroes as they complete research and crafting projects. These events are
entirely optional. If your group prefers a game where the heroes simply
work toward their goals by making project rolls, that’s fine. But using
these events can help a Diretor inject more drama into the processes
of research and crafting.
```

```
When To Use Project Events
Projects don’t need an event every time a Herói makes a Lançamento de Projeto.
If they did, the heroes would likely Gastar all their time trying to
manage their projects and never do qualquer Aventurando. Instead, you as
the Diretor pick um of the following methods to determine when an
event occurs during a Projeto de Tempo Livre. You can always Interruptor up the
method you use during a campaign, doing whatever you think works
best for the current situation.
```

```
Roll for Event
If you want events to be a surprise for you as much as for the other
jogadores, then once during qualquer Descanso when um or more heroes makes a
Lançamento de Projeto, roll a d6. On a 6, an event occurs. This is a good option if you
enjoy coming up with story on the Voar during play.
```

```
Event Milestones
If you want to guarantee that events occur during a Projeto de Tempo Livre,
use event milestones based on project points. When the project accrues
a certain number of points, an event occurs the next time a Herói wants
to make a Lançamento de Projeto. This approach works well if you want to plan
your event in detail before it occurs.
You can use the Suggested Event Milestones table to determine when
an event should occur during a project.
```

```
Suggested Event Milestones
Objetivo de Projeto Milestones
30 or fewer Nenhuma
31–200 um event halfway to the goal
201–999 dois events at um-third and dois-thirds of the way to the goal
```

```
1,000 or more três events at um-quarter, um-half, and três-quarters of the way to the goal
```

```
Downtime Projects
```

Whenever You Want
Whenever you think the heroes could use a little drama during a
Descanso, Jogar in an event. This approach allows you to plan an event
in detail when a Projeto de Tempo Livre starts, then deploy it at the most
dramatic moment—or even Jogar it in during an Encontro if you’re
feeling saucy!

Deploying Events
A Evento de Projeto occurs when a Herói makes a Lançamento de Projeto. You can roll for
or choose an event from the appropriate events prompts table, or use
the tables to inspire your own events. Each event entry on the table is
a narrative prompt written for you as the Diretor, and which you can
change and flesh out as you determine. Each event specifies whether it
occurs before or after the Lançamento de Projeto is resolved.

Automatic Avanço
If an event grants an automatic Avanço on a Projeto de Tempo Livre,
the project gains 20 project points and the Herói can make another
Lançamento de Projeto for the same project as part of the same Descanso activity.

Crafting Projects

Crafting projects enable heroes to create vehicles, Sobrenatural
treasures, and more. When you start a Projeto de Criação, other criaturas
can also work on the project, using their Descanso activity to contribute a
Lançamento de Projeto in Ordem to get the work done faster.

Unless a project has a event table of its own, the Diretor uses the
Crafting and Research Events table for Projeto de Criação events.

**Build Airship**

Item Pré-requisito: Wind Crystal of Quintessência
Origem do Projeto: Texts or lore in Low Rhyvian
Lançamento de Projeto Characteristic: Músculo, Razão, or Presença
**Objetivo de Projeto:** 3,000

When you start this project, you hire a crew of carpenters, mages, and
shipwrights who work in the Área where the project is undertaken,
with these artisans building the ship for you. You can make a project
roll whenever you are overseeing the project, which you Músculo be able
to do remotely through the use of Magia or Psiônica.

When the project is completed, you have an airship. You and qualquer
criaturas you designate can operate the ship by touching the ship’s
wheel. During Combate, a criatura touching the wheel can use a
Manobra to make the ship Mover up to 10 squares. The ship can be
moved only once per Ronda. Out of Combate, the ship has a Velocidade of 130
miles per day.

An airship is an objeto (giving it Imunidade a Dano all to Veneno and
Psíquico dano) and can take 200 dano before it is destroyed. If the
dano the ship takes is not too severe (as the Diretor determines), as
long as you have access to materials that can repair the ship, you can
restore it back to its original Condição as a Descanso activity.

Build or Repair Road
Item Pré-requisito: três writs of approval, from an engineers’ guild, a
masons’ guild, and a guards’ guild
Origem do Projeto: Texts or lore in Caeliano
Lançamento de Projeto Characteristic: Músculo, Razão, or Presença
Objetivo de Projeto: Varies
When you start this project, you hire a crew of masons, engineers, and
guards who start work at the location where the project begins and build
or repair the road for you. You can make a Lançamento de Projeto whenever you are
overseeing the project, whether you do so in person or remotely through
the use of Magia or Psiônica.
```

```
The number of project points required to complete work on the road
equals 10 × the road’s length in miles. The goal is cut in half if you are
repairing an existing road, or if someone else starts work on a second road
project that connects to your project.
When you complete the project, you earn Renome among people in the
Área where the road is built, depending on the length of the road.
```

```
Time spent traveling between locations on the road is cut in half. Access to
resources and Conhecimento is improved in locations along the road, giving
you and your aliados an Vantagem on project rolls to discover lore while you are
in those areas.
```

```

```
Before the roll, crews uncover an ancient road following the intended route,
crafted with remarkable techniques that make it a sturdy base on which to build.
The project gains an automatic Avanço and the Objetivo de Projeto is halved if it
was not already halved.
```

```
2
```

```
After the roll, the local population grows in excitement with each completed
portion of the road. The name of the Herói making the Lançamento de Projeto spreads as a
builder of bridges both literal and social. If the Lançamento de Projeto is 12 or higher, the local
community comes together to complete the project alongside the Herói’s hired
crew. The Herói doubles the Renome earned at the end of the project.
```

```

```

```
Before the roll, a local religious or civic authority hears of the project and sends
laborers to Acelerar it—in Mercado for a future favor. The Herói gains an
immediate 50 project points for the project if they accept the help.
```

```
4
```

```
After the roll, local hired hands and the project engineers find themselves at
odds, hindering the project. If the Herói can’t help defuse the situation, the project
requires an additional 50 project points to complete. 
```

```
5
```

```
Before the roll, supply caravans are disrupted by bandits, requiring extra guards.
If the Herói can’t deal with the bandit threat personally, the project requires an
additional 50 project points to complete.
```

```
6
```

```
After the roll, word is heard that not everyone in the local Área is happy about the
road being built. The project is hindered by Sobrenatural curses that cause stones
to Mover, vines and Matagal to reclaim sections already built, or churning
Terra to restore the road back to its previous form. The Herói must make amends
to the local Sobrenatural community or have the Renome earned by completing
the project not extend to that community.
```

```
7
```

```
After the roll, ditchers working on the project hit an ancient well, retaining Parede,
or Escondida stream that results in an immediate flood. The work is delayed, but
the new Água source ultimately provides a boon to local farming communities.
Project points earned by this roll are halved, but upon the project’s completion,
the Herói earns 1 additional Renome.
```

```

```

```
Before the roll, a new engineer arrives with Especialista experience such as building
sturdy wooden bridges, using bilge pumps to keep rainwater from slowing the
work, and so forth. They want to work on the project, but insist on receiving
a Consumível Tesouro first. If they are hired, the project gains an automatic
Avanço.
```

```
9
```

```
Before the roll, the proposed road touches on a Sobrenatural intersection—a
crossing place between multiple worlds that draws Interesse from a powerful Diabo.
The completion of the project becomes the personal Interesse of this being, who
offers to increase progress—but demands a future favor from the Herói. If the deal
is accepted, each Lançamento de Projeto for the project is doubled until its completion.
```

```

```

```
After the roll, a guildmaster has it out for the Herói. Whether from a past conflict or

Craft Teleportation Platform
Item Pré-requisito: um spatial navigator
Origem do Projeto: Texts or lore in Voll
Lançamento de Projeto Characteristic: Razão
Objetivo de Projeto: 1,500
```

```
When you complete this project, you end up with a 3-Quadrado-by-3-
Quadrado teleportation platform activated by a Sobrenatural password.
The platform is permanently affixed to the Chão in the location
where you create it. qualquer criatura with the password can use the
teleportation platform to instantly Teleportar-se qualquer criaturas or objetos on
the platform to a location they know, including another teleportation
platform whose Sobrenatural password they know. You and qualquer
criatura you designate upon completion of the activity can change the
password as a Descanso activity.
Each time the teleportation platform is used, the chance of it malfunc-
tioning and teleporting criaturas or objetos on it to a random platform
increases by 1 percent (to a maximum of 50 percent). You can restore
the platform back to its original Condição and reset this chance of
malfunction as a Descanso activity.
```

```
Craft Tesouro
You can craft the items found in Treasures in Chapter 13: Rewards. Each
Tesouro notes its Item Pré-requisito, Origem do Projeto, Lançamento de Projeto charac-
teristic, and Objetivo de Projeto.
```

**Find a Cure**

```
Item Pré-requisito: Varies (see description)
Origem do Projeto: Nenhuma
Lançamento de Projeto Characteristic: Razão or Intuição
Objetivo de Projeto: Varies
You research a cure for a disease, curse, or Sobrenatural affliction whose
text states that it can be ended by the Find a Cure Projeto de Tempo Livre. If
the affliction was caused by the innate Recurso of a criatura, you need
the remains of that criatura or another criatura of the same kind as an
Item Pré-requisito for crafting the cure. For example, you can research
the cure for the affliction of a Lobisomem ’s Mordida Amaldiçoada by studying the
corpse of qualquer Lobisomem, not just the um who did the biting.
```

```
The number of project points it takes to complete this project is equal
to 50 times the Nível of the criatura who caused the affliction. If the
affliction was created by an environmental or Sobrenatural Efeito,
that Efeito notes the Item Pré-requisito and project points required to
complete this project.
When you complete this project, you craft um dose of an alchemical
cure for the affliction. Once the project is completed, you can craft
subsequent doses for the same affliction for half the number of project
points required for the initial project.
```

**Imbue Tesouro**

```
You can create leveled treasures by imbuing items with Magia or
Psiônica Poder. You must have a Mundano version of the item you plan
to imbue, such as a sword or Escudo, when you start this project.
You can imbue qualquer item três times. The first time you imbue it,
you pick a 1st-Nível enhancement. The second time you imbue it,
you pick a 5th-Nível enhancement. The third time you imbue it, you
pick a 9th-Nível enhancement. A Herói using armor or a Arma can’t
Benefício from an enhancement unless they are using a kit that includes
the armor or Arma Tipo, and their Nível matches the enhance-
ment’s Nível.
```

```
If an enhancement has a Roman numeral greater than I after it, such as
the Faseamento III enhancement, that enhancement can’t be applied unless
the item has all previous versions of the enhancement. This means you
can’t imbue armor with the Faseamento III enhancement unless it has the
Faseamento I and Faseamento II enhancements first. The effects of numbered
enhancements are cumulative unless otherwise noted.
Enhancements are broken out by item Tipo (armor, Implementos, or
Arma) and Nível. Each item Tipo and Nível features a table showing
the name, Item Pré-requisito, and Origem do Projeto idioma of each
enhancement. Imbued items take the Magia or Psiônica Palavra-Chave (your
choice) and are part of qualquer kit categories appropriate to the Tipo of item
(Armadura Leve, Arma Média, and so forth).
```

```
Imbuing Tesouro with Sobrenatural Poder as a Projeto de Tempo Livre
typically means you undertake that project to make use of the Tesouro
yourself. As such, all the features of imbuing refer to “you” as the user of
the item. However, imbued items can be created for other criaturas, or
created by other criaturas and found as Tesouro.
```

Downtime Projects

Research Projects

Heroes can undertake many different types of research downtime
projects, which can involve procurar out new lore, improving existing
Conhecimento with study, uncovering Boatos or secrets, and more.

Unless a project has a event table of its own or a Especial event entry,
the Diretor uses the Crafting and Research Events table for research
project events.

**Discover Lore**

**Item Pré-requisito:** Nenhuma
**Origem do Projeto:** Texts or Conhecimento related to the subject you
wish to research
**Lançamento de Projeto Characteristic:** Razão
**Objetivo de Projeto:** Varies (see the table)

If you want to Rastrear the location of a lost Tesouro, decipher a ritual, or
trace the lineage of a royal family to find the next heir to the throne,
you can start a Projeto de Tempo Livre to delve into whatever mysteries you
seek to unravel. You Músculo start a project to discover lore because the
information can’t be discovered through a single Teste, or you could do so
because you failed a Teste to Recolher information and now want to learn it
through research.

When you start a Projeto de Tempo Livre to discover lore, you choose the
lore you want investigated and the questions you want answered. The
Diretor tells you if the lore you seek amounts to common, obscure,
lost, or forbidden Conhecimento. The more esoteric the Conhecimento, the
more project points are required to find the answers you seek.

```
Discover Lore Project Goals
Objetivo de Projeto
Common Conhecimento 15
Obscure Conhecimento 45
Lost Conhecimento 120
Forbidden Conhecimento 240
```

Common Conhecimento
Common Conhecimento is generally easy to discover with a day or so of
research. It’s not known by every passerby and takes time to uncover,
but with plentiful local sources for the information, you don’t need
to Gastar a lot of time searching. It could be that you need to question
several members of a rumor mill to figure out who a Nobre is not-so-se-
cretly courting, or you Músculo need to Gastar a few hours in a temple to
find the particular religious text that carries a seldom-used alternative
name for a deity.

```
Obscure Conhecimento
Obscure Conhecimento is known only to specialized sages and is typically
of Interesse only to those scholars. As such, precious few tomes are
written on obscure subjects. Finding the right expert to interview
or the best book to read typically requires several days of research.
Uncovering the details of a ritual used to Receptivo and close a portal to the
Sea of Stars isn’t easy information to come by, but there are people out
there who know how to do it—and who wrote the instructions down.
```

```
Lost Conhecimento
Lost Conhecimento is so esoteric that even among a field’s most dedicated
scholars, there Músculo be only um or dois individuals who have dug
deep enough to know that lore. Lost Conhecimento could come from a
time so long ago that only a single text in a dead idioma now holds
the lore you seek. Such lore often takes more than a week to hunt
down. The location of a legendary steel Anão ’s workshop is most likely
lore that is lost—except for um map Escondida in a private collection.
```

```
Forbidden Conhecimento
Forbidden Conhecimento is lore that a powerful individual or Organização
is attempting to keep secret. Those who know the secrets speak of
them in whispered codes after passwords are exchanged, and write
texts using ciphers. Hunting down leads and making sense of them
typically takes weeks. The location of the dagger that slit the throat of
the god of Morte is Escondida behind layers of encoded text and written in
a dead idioma known only to that god’s most devout followers.

In spite of this the people of Orden, regardless of Linhagem, do
not believe the gods control everything that happens in the
world. They believe the gods created a natural world with its own
cycles that are sometimes predictable, but which cannot be
understood. It rained last Lyleth, and the Lyleth before that, so it’ll
probably rain this Lyleth—but maybe not! And if not, that may be
because the gods are displeased. But it Músculo just as easily be because
the gods are bored, or fickle or—even more likely, it has nothing to do
with the gods, and there’s no way to know which.

When a river floods or crops fail, some people may curse the gods, but
those people do not all believe a god caused these events. They may
curse simply because the gods didn’t prevent catastrophe. They do
not think, “Why did the gods do that?” They think, “Why did the gods
make a world that behaves like this?”

The gods are powerful, but forbidden from acting directly upon or
within the world. To enact their will, they use intermediaries—beings
of Semideus-like status, once mortals, who now serve their patron god
in eternity. Many humans call these beings saints, while the other
speaking peoples use the term heroes, or legendary heroes, not to be
confused with the heroes you make using the personagem Criação rules
in this book.

Each god has many saints, some obscure. They sometimes manifest
in the world. These encounters are always brief, Conduzindo sages and
theologians to conclude there must be some limit to how much time
or energy these saints and legendary heroes can Gastar on the prime
Variedade. Who created or enforces these limits?

No um knows.

As a result of this complex tapestry of belief and personalities, a Fazendeiro
in Aendrim Músculo call upon Adûn for strength while tilling the Terra.
But if a cool breeze suddenly came along, easing the Morder of the Sol on
their back, they would almost certainly not thank Adûn or qualquer of his
saints. They would probably thank Saint Elspeth the Blithe, sometimes
called the Summer Breeze. If they had a neighbor or relative with a
shrine to Saint Elspeth in their home, they Músculo give that person a
small gift or offering and ask them to place it on their shrine. More
likely, they would silently promise to do this, and then forget or get
Distraído.

If questioned about this—“Why did you call upon um god, but thank
the saint of a completely different god?”—they would first be Surpreso
by the question. It would not have occurred to them to examine this
behavior. If pressed they would say, “Oh, I’m sure they worked it out
between them.” They would not imagine, “Adûn told Viras, who told
her saint, Elspeth, to send a cooling breeze,” but they would assume

```
something like that happened and not worry overmuch about the
details. They called out, they received aid—that’s what’s important.
```

If no aid is forthcoming folks assume this is because the gods and saints
are all very busy and cannot be arsed to answer every Prece. People
are never Surpreso when the gods and saints are silent. They are
usually silent.

Churches and Temples
Most religions in Orden organize themselves into hierarchies and build
temples or cathedrals, but some religions are little more than traditions
handed down from shaman to shaman, or wise-woman to wise-daugh-
ter. Some religions are secret!

Because the gods are forbidden from acting directly upon the world,
churches and temples in Orden are consecrated to saints, or heroes.
There are no temples to Ord or churches of Cavall. Instead, there is the
Church of Zarok the Law-Giver and the Church of Saint Llewellyn the
Valiant. Everyone knows which god these heroes and saints serve, it’s
common Conhecimento. A Humano in Vasloria Músculo call out to Cavall for
aid in times of need but they know that, should Cavall choose to help,
it will be by sending um of his saints.
The most popular saints and heroes can have several churches—
meaning distinct organizations—devoted to them, each with their own
rituals. In Corwell, there is the Church of Saint Llewellyn the Valiant,
but there is also the smaller Church of Saint Llewellyn the Charitable
with only a few temples.

Usually, these churches recognize each other as expressing different,
equally valid teachings of the same saint, but occasionally churches
compete to see which among them is the “true” church. The saints
don’t discourage this, so they must, in some sense, approve.
There are churches dedicated to Natureza or Conhecimento or the Sol, with
no Tempo Limpo moral or ethical component to them. There are evil churches,
churches devoted to dark saints and tyrant gods. But the saints and
heroes listed here each have churches that, however esoteric their
teachings (usually referred to as the “speech” or “words” of the saint
or Herói) expect their clergy to go forth into the world and perform
good deeds—tend to the sick, ease pain, perform birth, Morte, and
union rituals. These churches all have Acólitos and abbots, censors
and conduits. It is not so much that Grole the um-Handed was, in
Vida, principally concerned with the spiritual wellbeing of his people ,
but rather that this is what people expect of churches. So, as a Religião
grows, it soon conforms to the expectations of the people such that
even the church of Khorvath Who Slew A Thousand has conduits who
Curar the sick and tend to the souls of their people.

Interspecies Worship
Elves, dwarves, and orcs revere their own creator gods. Val, Ord, and Kul
respectively. Humans, uniquely, worship many gods. The difference
between the Incontáveis Deuses Jovens of the humans and the Elder
Gods who created the other speaking peoples is not well understood.

```
Dwarves mostly venerate Anão heroes, humans mostly worship
Humano saints, and so on ... But this is just a side Efeito of the fact that
members of the same Linhagem share the same Cultura and idioma
and Personagem-assemble along those lines. qualquer sufficiently large city,
regardless of which species founded it, has churches and temples
to gods of many species because cities attract people of many
different species.
Each Cultura’s pantheon reflects the mores and folkways of the people
who live there. In far northern Vanigar, villains in folktales often gain
their Poder by tricking others through clever wordplay. Riddles.
Though they are villains, they are clever, and this earns them some
respect even from their inimigos. So the Vanigar pantheon includes
Holkatya, a trickster god.
```

```
Whereas Vasloria has no folk tradition of trickster figures, and so has no
trickster god. Instead, villains in Vasloriano folktales tend to be people
who seek quick ways to Poder in Ordem to avoid honest work. So
Vasloria has the dark god Cyrvis who teaches that Magia can subvert
Destino and make you master of not only your destiny, but also the world.
This also reveals the common Vasloriano’s Atitude toward Magia.
The gods of each pantheon tell you what the people of that region
value, and what they fear, disapprove of, or distrust. The Vasloriano
pantheon is wholly different from the pantheon of Vanigar which is
different from the pantheon of Rioja. The gods and saints can hear their
Adoradores anywhere in the timescape and even small cities can have
```

```
temples to distant gods of other peoples and regions. All it takes is um
dedicated Conduíta to establish a church of their saint or Herói in some
distant land.
```

```
For instance, A Alta Cidade de Dalrath, a small barony in northern
Aendrim, has a temple to Sektahre the Boatman, a saint of Khemhara, a
distant desert region. The people of Dalrath do not find this strange. The
priestess of Sektahre does all the same things qualquer native curate would
do: perform rituals, Curar the sick, and otherwise tend to the spiritual
and physical wellbeing of the locals without asking much in return.
Some people may be Desconfiado of a stranger peddling their Religião
far from home, but yet more people consider the Presença of such a
priestess a sign that their city must be very important indeed.
Because of all these gods and saints, Religião in Orden is a very à la carte
affair. There are Humano heroes in the elf pantheon. There are Anão
saints in many Humano pantheons. Elder or younger, the gods do not
care much about their followers’ biology. If you devote your Vida to the
teachings of a god and do good works in their name, you can expect to
be rewarded regardless of your Linhagem. And, though the Era dos Santos
is long past, most folk believe it is still possible for a mortal to ascend to
sainthood or herodom, even in this late age.
```

```
Lastly, though rulers across the land instinctively believe the gods are
paying more attention to them because they are queens or dukes or
the heads of a powerful wizard Ordem or guild ... there is no evidence
of this. As far as theologists can tell, the gods seem to view every soul
as equally worthy. Many of the Contos de Santos e Heróis Recurso
characters of enormous Poder Divino battling over the soul of a normal
person with no station or Poder or inheritance.
As much as it annoys the great and the good, the gods view all
mortals as equals.
```

Evil Gods and Saints

```
The gods and saints presented in this chapter are popular and
well-known. Their priests, shamans, or god-callers serve the public weal
and tend to the souls of the people.
But the world is not for heroes alone. There are villains, as well as those
who are simply misguided or desperate. Every pantheon has saints,
even gods, who teach the virtues of selfishness, cruelty, the pursuit of
Poder for its own sake, and the right of the Forte to do as they please.
```

```
These religions do not usually build public temples and worship in
the Receptivo, but most communities know, or very strongly suspect, who
among them serve evil gods and saints.
Among the people of Vasloria, there are the gods Nikros, o Tirano and
Cyrvis o Lich, evil gods, each with their own saints. When tyrants
rule, these religions tend to come out from the basements and sew-
er-temples and start worshipping openly.
```

Afterlife in Orden

```
Folk in Orden believe that most, maybe all, living things have a soul,
which is the source of personality, creativity, and memory. The loss of
um’s soul, either through bargaining with a Diabo, or being consumed
by a Demônio or otherwise trapped by a warlock, results in slowly losing
your personality, your distinctiveness—even memory.
However, there is no popular idea that everyone’s soul is immortal and
persists forever after Morte. Most people believe their soul dissipates
after Morte and becomes um with Criação. When asked where the
soul goes after Morte, the elf Sábio responded by blowing out a candle
and asking, “Where did the Fogo go?”
```

How To Use This Chapter
Draw Steel isn’t about Religião qualquer more than it is about
idioma or Tesouro, but understanding how Religião works in
a day-to-day sense can help make the game world feel more
real. The people in Orden aren’t qualquer more religious than the
people of Terra were in the premodern era. It is a factor in their
lives, but not the only factor—and for some people, not a very
important um.
Obviously, Conduíta and Censurador jogadores can use this chapter
to choose a saint, each saint’s entry also lists which domains
they represent. But each god also has a list of domains, so
an enterprising jogador could just invent a new saint, Herói, or
Arauto choosing dois domains from a god’s list.
But qualquer jogador Músculo wonder, “Does my personagem follow the
teachings of qualquer saint or god?” Think about the people you
know in the real world who wear religious or quasi-religious
talismans every day. A symbol on a necklace, a sticker on their
car, a tattoo. Normal people often carry religious talismans,
your personagem in Draw Steel Músculo not be particularly religious,
but they Músculo still carry a religious talisman just because it’s
a family tradition or to remind themselves of the religious
instruction they received in church as a child.
We wrote a lot of words in this chapter because we wanted to
give characters from all ancestries a few choices when it comes
to saints and heroes. But your personagem can ignore all of this if
you think Religião isn’t a big part of their Vida.
```

```
Gods and Religião
```

In some cultures, exceptions are made for those mortals who lived an
especially virtuous Vida.

Much the same way the humans of Vanigar believe the bravest among
them live on after Morte drinking and telling tales at the Mesa de Guerra—the
wartable—most elves believe that should they live a Vida of sufficient
meaning, should they do great deeds and embody Val’s ethos, they
earn the right to join Val in Arcádia after Morte. There they will live in a
timeless faerie world, “the world that should have been.”

Most dwarves believe that those members of each generation who best
distinguish themselves earn the right to live forever in Ord’s memory.
This, they believe, is where their heroes go after Morte. Uniquely among
the speaking peoples, the dwarves believe their god is watching them,
watching the world. Ord cannot act, but he judges and remembers.

Some people in Orden, like the Hakaan and the orcs believe their
ancestors watch over them, although there is no agreement whether
their ancestor’s souls are watching over them, or just their memory.
Or something in between. Sages differ. This belief among the orcs and
Hakaan is more of an Atitude, an assumption, than a Religião.

Conduits and Censors

“Conduíta” and “Censurador” are not a titles within qualquer church—they are jobs
or ranks. An abbot, rector, even a bishop may be, or may have been, a
Conduíta or a Censurador. Conduits and censors are those members of the
church expected to go out into the world and actively, sometimes very
actively, represent their saint’s ethos. It is for this purpose conduits and
censors are given access to powerful prayers.

qualquer sufficiently large Organização has conduits and censors just like
they have shadows and wizards. The thieves’ guild needs healers, just as
the church needs spies! A Conduíta who works for the thieves’ guild still
serves their saint which implicitly means the church approves of the
guild’s activities and the dois organizations are at least pointing in the
same Direção if not actively allied.

Churches have bureaucracy just like qualquer Organização and while some
prelates, abbots, bishops, or hierarchs are conduits, many are not. They
are normal people who serve the church in administrative, political,
or Burocrática roles. While they know the same minor orisons every
Acólito and abbot know, they do not go out into the world righting
wrongs, and so do not gain access to the powers of the Conduíta or Censurador.

The prayers Acólitos perform in churches are little more than magical
rituals. They say the right words, make the right gestures, touch the
appropriate fetish or talisman, and wounds close, curses are lifted,
blessings bestowed. There’s no direct connection in these examples
between the Acólito and their god or saint. Though, even a lowly
Acólito can expect to find their prayers fall on deaf ears if they fail to
uphold the tenets of their faith.

Should the Acólito continue in their studies and deeds and earn the
rank of Conduíta or Censurador, they gain access to greater prayers granted
them by their saint. As they Avançar in their faith they call upon their
saint more directly, and they begin to form a personal relationship with
their saint. It is a feeling that develops whereby the Conduíta learns the ...
mood, for lack of a better term, of their saint or Herói.

As they gain experience, a Conduíta or Censurador may even enter into
dialogue with their saint. When they call upon their saint for Poder in
battle, their saint personally answers them. They Músculo literally be on
first-name terms. At even higher levels, conduits begin to get a sense
of the greater Poder behind the saint or legendary Herói: their god,
who begins answering prayers directly. They become, in Efeito, little
mini-saints. The pathway from high-Nível Conduíta or Censurador to saint is
now obscure, but was once well-known. In earlier ages of the world, it

```
was expected that certain Sagrado heroes who had served their god and
saint well would—should appropriately dramatic circumstances reveal
themselves—be elevated to sainthood.

Va l
Domains: Criação, Conhecimento, Vida, Natureza, Proteção
```

```
Val, the Nobre Lord, First Among Equals, is the patron of the elves.
He created the celestials—the elvos verdadeiros, second of the five speaking
peoples—who then created the younger elves: the high, wode, and
Sombra elves. His name is the root of the Caeliano word “valiant,”
and the dwarves named the most precious ore in Orden—Valiar, the
truemetal—after him.
Val holds that the greatest purpose a thinking being can commit
themselves to is the Criação of art and the appreciation of beauty. He
keeps the magical, elf-haunted forests called wodes close to his heart
because they represent his Visão for Orden. What the world could
have been. His growing disgust with the concept of Guerra led him to leave
Orden and take up residence in his private Variedade, Arcádia where all
elves hope to someday join their patron.
```

**Heroes of the Elves**

```
The legendary heroes of the elves are once-mortal heroes who now
dwell in Arcádia and make up Val’s court there. They answer prayers
and dispense blessings and boons, even manifest in the world during
times of great need. (Though, like all the speaking people’s saints and
heroes, what these legendary figures consider “great need” is very
personal and has little to do with politics or great kingdoms.)
The Alto Elfo heroes detailed in this book are A Sea of Suns, the Provar of
Morning, and Ripples of Honey on a Shore of Gold. The Elfo Silvestre heroes
are Yllin Dyrvis, Thyll Hylacae, and Illwyv li Orchiax.
```

```
A Sea of Suns
Domains: Criação, Vida
```

```
A Sea of Suns, also known as the Composer.
Credited with inventing harmony, it is said that after she discovered
the Poder of blending many voices into um, the elves sang for an entire
century uninterrupted 1. The harmonics so complicated they created
new beings like faeries, dryads, and the elgenwights.
```

```
The Composer discovered, or invented, the Poder of Música to
manipulate reality. Her troubadours, it was said, could return the dead
to Vida. “In the Música, you can live forever.” Legend has it she was at the
battle of Kalas Valiar when the first Exército da Noite besieged its walls.
When their Corrupção engines Enfraquecido the impenetrable walls,
she stood alone on the parapets and sang. For forty days did her Voz
bolster the walls, stemming the flood of evil. Her song ended only when
her Vida was taken by Um Coração Preso em Âmbar, the sorcerer-Assassino of
the star elves.
```

```
1 If this story wasn’t invented by the dwarves or humans, it must at least
have passed through um of their cultures. The celestials did not reckon time
the way younger species do and would not have said “for an entire century.”

The Provar of Morning
**Domains:** Criação, Conhecimento

The Provar of Morning, also known as the Librarian.

Credited with building the first library, most scholars consider this a
real, historical event (never a certainty with the tales of the legendary
heroes) and adventurers through all ages have sought this legendary
building. If, indeed, it was a building.

He canonized the idea that Conhecimento, truth, was a kind of beauty. The
Library of Morning was a temple to thought, wisdom, scholarship. It
contained plays, poems, histories, treatises on the Natureza of reality. The
Conhecimento held within was incalculable. Legends say it held codices
written by the elder dragons, though modern scholars suspect this is
a literary conceit, as there is no evidence the elder dragons bothered
with writing.

Ripples of Honey on a Shore of Gold
**Domains:** Vida, Proteção

Ripples of Honey on a Shore of Gold, also known as Warkiller, the
Diplomat, was both scholar, Sábio, and Soldado. She served as emissary
between the humans and the dragons when the former sought Guerra
against the latter. For many years she brokered Paz, but she could not
stem the tides of Guerra forever.

In the end, her efforts failed, and the elder dragons live no more in
this world. Like Val, the Diplomat hated Guerra so much, after her Falha
she sought to pen a new codex. A work so powerful it would bind the
world. The Codex Pax Universalis would Banir the concept of Guerra
from Orden. Alas, in the end she realized there was only um way to
finish her great work, and she was not willing to take that final step.

Yllin Dyrvis
**Domains:** Conhecimento, Natureza

Yllin Dyrvis, also known as the Fera Heart, the Wodespeaker, the
Guardião, witnessed the Composer’s first song, and took it upon
themselves to communicate with and care for the speaking criaturas
A Sea of Suns created. The dryads, elgenwights, the Gigante birds and
intelligent peixe who populated the ancient wode that once covered
all Orden, all came under the Fera Heart’s care. Dyrvis learned their
speech and taught them who they were.

To this day, many ages of the world later, A Silva elves consider
themselves the stewards of the speaking criaturas, and those criaturas
rely upon A Silva elves for Proteção.

Thyll Hylacae
**Domains:** Vida, Natureza

Thyll Hylacae, the Forestal, Apothachron, also known as the Sacrifício.
Thyll spoke to the plants, learned their truths—discovered many
magics Escondida within. The Poder to Curar, harm, change. It was Hylacae
who first sensed, then learned, the idioma of trees. She studied, cared
for them, and protected them when the folk of farm and field came to
cut them down.

Though she was mighty in warlore, she could not be everywhere. In the
end, she sacrificed herself for the trees, the ritual she performed uplifted
a small population of trees, creating the derwic—the thinking speaking
tree-peoples few of whom remain in Orden.

```
Illwyv li Orchiax
Domains: Natureza, Proteção
Illwyv li Orchiax, the Moonknight, Marshall of the Gloaming,
Manslayer. When humans first arrived in Orden—it is said—they were
welcomed by the other speaking peoples. But they were unlike the
other creations in the world. While the dwarves cut rock for the ore
within, humans cut down trees simply because they were in the way.
Other ancestries had their own territories and homelands, but humans
sought constant expansion into even the most inhospitable territories.
```

```
Illwyv it was who first realized the folly of treating with these criaturas. A
great Caçador of the Corte do Carvalho, she gathered her band of Elite Helriath
Harriers and made Guerra on the humans who would kill A Silva.
```

```
Ord
Domains: Criação, Conhecimento, Proteção, Sol, Guerra
```

```
Ord, the Maker, the Engineer, is the patron of the dwarves. Ord, along
with his siblings Aan, Eth, and Kul, created Orden. These four saw the
world as a dynamic expression of their philosophies.
Ord values integrity, honor, faithfulness to an ideal. Courage in
battle and fair play. Treating your opponent honorably, Ord teaches,
is an expression of your own worthiness. Ord is associated with
permanence, which some elder dwarves take to mean a kind of slavish
devotion to tradition. But Ord teaches permanence is the quality of
reliability, of steadfastness. Young dwarves who chafe at the stale and
stifling traditions of their elders remind the greybeards that Ord is the
Maker. He expects his children to create marvels, to bring forth new
discoveries, new insights. To remake the world anew each generation.
```

**Heroes of the Dwarves**

```
The following heroes are venerated by many dwarves and others
who follow Ord.
```

```
Zarok the Law-Giver
Domains: Proteção, Guerra
Zarok the Law-Giver. Zarok the Professor. Zarok who is Justiça.
```

```
The first, great Herói of the dwarves, Zarok was a noted general,
diplomat, and poet. In his time each Anão city-state had its own laws
which were mostly just lists of offenses with punishments listed next
to them. There was no consistency from um city to another and no
underlying theory of law. The Forte ruled, the rest obeyed.
It was after Zarok retired from his Carreira as a Mestre de Guerra and became
the ambassador to the elves that he undertook a study of how different
cultures express the idea of Justiça. He surveyed the various traditions
of elves, humans, and orcs and wrote The As Conversas —a series of
fictional dialogues in which dois characters, deliberately chosen from
Anão theater so as to be Familiar to his audience, debate the question:
“What are the characteristics of a just Sociedade?”
```

```
The As Conversas marks the beginning of legal theory in Orden. It
sought not only to state what a just Sociedade was, but to prove it ethically
through a series of logical statements. Most of the work concerns itself
with the proper, ethical uses of political Poder. The adversarial system
of legal representation is his.
Zarok teaches that all people should be equal under the law. His is the
principle of fair play—sportsmanship. Respect for your adversary. The
responsibility of the Forte to protect the Fraca.
```

```
Zarok’s The As Conversas are still quoted today. There is a long legal
tradition, when a prestigious lawyer in Capital wishes to write an
amicus brief without revealing their identity, they sign it “Z.”

Valak-koth the Seeker
Domains: Conhecimento, Sol
Valak-koth the Seeker, the Delver, the Fogo Inextinguível, Koth Who
Brought Luz to Darkness, said she heard voices in the rock as a child.
These days this would result in a visit to the apothecary or a change
in diet, but in those days the world was young and a child who heard
voices Músculo Turno out to be a prophet of Ord. Her parents listened and
soon Nenhuma doubted.
```

```
She would run, heedless of danger, into the dark caves below and
wherever she pointed, marvels were found: metals, gems, fantastic ores.
Caves as big as nations. It was Valak-koth it was who first discovered
Aerithyst, a Gema Solar, a crystal mineral which glows upon contact with
living things.
Valak-koth teaches bravery in the face of the unknown, the Virtude of
curiosity, to seek endlessly and quest for Conhecimento, not to fear the
darkness. To bring Luz into dark places. Valak-koth it was who first
discovered O Mundo Inferior, A Escuridão Abaixo de Tudo, though it was not
recognized as a separate Variedade until after her Morte. After her Morte,
the original Sungem she found refused to dim. It was enshrined in
her temple-tomb, now lost along with the ancient Pedra Anão city of
Kas Koriar.
```

```
Stakros the Engineer
Domains: Criação, Conhecimento
```

```
Stakros o Engenheiro, a Mente Máquina, o Operador, founder of the
Ordem da Fabricação.
Stakros it was— not a steel Anão—who forged the first strife-engine,
a great Guerra-walker manned by thirty dwarves. At the battle of Kalas
Mithral, the Guerra-walker grappled with the legion of yllindyr the star
elves summoned to defeat the walls of the steel Anão capital.
```

```
After the Guerra, Stakros turned his talents to peaceful pursuits. He forged
the first Mergulhador de Magma, designed to withstand enormous temperatures
and pressures, all the while protecting the Operador within. Inside
his marvel Stakros personally dove into the great volcano Oxor-myr,
returning with marvelous ores never before seen in Orden. His
design soon evolved into a variety of armored frames to suit a variety
of purposes.
Stakros teaches the value of Conhecimento for Conhecimento’s sake, and the
Poder of the mind to overcome qualquer obstacle. He also teaches that
Conhecimento is Poder, and in unready hands can only be dangerous.
```

Kul

```
Domains: Conhecimento, Vida, Sol, Trapaça, Guerra
Kul, Father of Flames, Lord of the Forge, the Cleansing Fogo who put Fogo
and magma within the world at its Criação.
```

```
He saw his sibling gods creating their own children and placing them
within the world, and so followed suit, creating the orcs, the last of the
original Cinco Povos Falantes.
Kul’s Fogo is the Fogo that destroys, but it is also the Fogo that creates,
the Fogo of the forge, the Fogo that makes meat safe to eat, the Fogo that
cauterizes wounds. Kul teaches that action is the defining characteristic
of being. Kul’s heroes are not philosophers or poets, but warriors
and hunters.
```

```
Uniquely among the Elder Creator Gods, Kul does not desire worship—
finds it distasteful. Orcs still call out to Kul in desperate times as “Kul
Who Once Spoke.” But in those moments, they do not call out for
aid—only that Kul witness them, and that they Músculo prove worthy of
his attention.
```

```
Heroes of the Orcs
The following heroes are venerated by many orcs and others
who follow Kul.
```

```
Khorvath Who Slew a Thousand
Domains: Sol, Guerra
```

```
When Khorvath, Líder de Guerra for the Elétrico orc clan set out with her
warband of bloodrunners, they numbered less than fifty. When they
finally arrived at the Cidade Solar, seat of the pharaoh of Khemhara, they
had grown to over dois thousand orcs from over thirty orc clans, all
eager for battle. Legends later swelled that number to ten thousand. 
Upon their arrival, the bloodrunners found their prospective employer
embattled and surrounded by inimigos, the pharaoh’s brother having
raised rebellion against him. Principally due to Khorvath’s help, the
pharaoh’s brother was killed and his army defeated. But the pharaoh
died in the battle, and Khorvath found herself and her warband
without a patron in an alien land surrounded by inimigos fighting a Guerra
of succession.
```

```
“What do we do, Líder de Guerra?” Her Capitão da Morte asked. 
Khorvath oriented herself and pointed northwest. “Home is that
way. We march!”
```

```
Capitão da Morte Voyrik’s eyes went wide. “It’s três thousand miles,” he
pointed out—and the journey to Khemhara had not been uneventful!
“Best get started,” Khorvath said, and set off. 
```

```
How long it took the bloodrunners of the Elétrico to cross the desert
is not well-attested. It took four or six months depending on which
accounts you read, but even six months would make their march a
legendary journey.
Opposed at every Turno by the local Nobre houses and then eventually
the desert clans who sought the bounty placed on Khorvath’s head, the
ten thousand grew in battle prowess as they demolished qualquer inimigo
foolish enough to get in their way. Given the many tens of thousands
of warriors the bloodrunners dispatched over the course of four (or six)
months, it may well be that Khorvath’s sobriquet was literal.
```

```
Sucesso was a double edged sword. The more victories they earned
in battle, the easier they were to follow. “Our inimigos Andar the red
road,” Voyrik once said, looking at the vast swath of blood they left in
their wake.  
“We have nothing to fear,” Khorvath said. “These people fight for
pride, or a bounty. We’re fighting for our lives. All it takes is um good
punch in the nose and they retreat.” And indeed this proved true
for many weeks.
```

```
Eventually três of the desert tribes allied themselves and this was a
coalition that could take a few bloody noses without giving up. They
cornered the bloodrunners in a ravine that led to a Montanha pass. It
was possible to Navegação the narrow pass, but only dois or três orcs
at a time. It would take hours to retreat that way. And the três tribes
blocked their way out.
Khorvath saw the way. She unwound her mother’s hand wraps from
her forearms and wrapped them around her own fists. The brown
stains on the knuckles made Khorvath proud.
```

```
“I will take the best Guerreiro from each of the 30 tribes,” Khorvath
pronounced, and word spread almost instantly. Within minutes, the
thirty best warriors among the ten thousand stood with Khorvath. “We
thirty will hold the pass.”
```

```
Gods and Religião
```

Capitão da Morte Voyrik, eyes wide, whispered Khorvath’s name.

Khorvath removed her torque of leadership and handed it to Voyrik.
“When you arrive home, give this to my son.” She looked at the torque
in Voyrik’s hands. “Tell him my last thoughts were of him. And that it is
my wish that this torque inspire him to great deeds.”

The tale of Khorvath’s Thirty is still popular among the orcs, though
everyone listening understands the “três days of Guerra” is pure fiction,
as Nenhuma of the thirty survived. It is nonetheless broadly taken as true.

Khorvath’s Thirty bought the bloodrunners the time they needed to
escape through the pass, and onward Desimpedido.

By the time they reached the eastern side of the Myr, Khorvath’s name
was already a legend, and many bloodrunners wore her clan fetish as
their talisman. Scaling the slopes of the Myr was not easy but as the
orcs descended down the western face, through the clouds, and saw the
endless sea of Verde that was the Great Wode, they cried out together
“Cekana! Cekana!” _The trees! The trees!_

The ten thousand were not home, but they were home free. For this
was territory held by their aliados. The church of Khorvath Who Slew a
Thousand spread quickly and now all orcs invoke her name whenever
faced with a seemingly impossible task.

Khorvath, like most orc heroes, teaches the Virtude of Resiliência. That
great problems are often just many tiny problems in Disfarce and that
by fighting each day as it comes, great battles can be won.

Khorvath Who Slew a Thousand would probably prefer to be
remembered as she was in Vida—Khorvath Who Brought Ten Thousand
Home, but even as um of the chief orc heroes, she has little influence
over the way the people choose to remember her.

Voyrik gave his Líder de Guerra’s torque to her son, who grew to Liderar the
Elétrico first as Líder de Guerra, then chieftain. He was a good ruler for
the Elétrico.

Grole the um-Handed
**Domains:** Vida, Guerra

Grole Uma Mão, Grole que Matou o Santo dos Crânios, lost his left
hand at Batalha de Dur Mothe where he stood alone against the Horda
of deathless and their master, the living saint Morath of Many Tendrils.
Grole thought to buy time for his army to escape the flood of Morte, but
when they saw their Líder de Guerra grappling alone with the Saint of Podridão,
they reversed their retreat. When Morath lashed out with his greataxe
Eviscerador and severed Grole’s left hand from his arm, Grole’s army
surged forward, breaking the tide of deathless.

His army watched as Kul’s Luz descended on their wounded Líder,
and they knew Grole had been chosen by Kul in that moment. At the
last, Grole and Morath fought as equals. Orc Herói and dark Humano saint
grappled atop the ancient hill. With his um good hand Grole plunged
the Fogo Verde, his grandmother’s saber, into Morath’s heart, ending the
Saint of Many Tendrils.

Grole teaches the extraordinary deeds common people can accomplish
if they cast fear from their minds. It was Grole who said, “Even should
an orc be pierced by many arrows, they should still be able to perform
um last act of revenge.”

Grole is the orcish Herói of those facing impossible decisions. He is
favored by most orcish leaders. Grole teaches that, even alone, even
against impossible odds, extraordinary victories are possible. Censors of
Grole often dip their left hand in ink before battle to symbolize Grole’s
missing hand.

Khravila Who Ran Forty Leagues
Domains: Conhecimento, Trapaça
Khravila Who Ran Forty Leagues, The Eternal Mensageiro, Khravila The
Implacável.
```

```
On the eve of a Guerra between elves and humans that would certainly
result in the Morte of many orcs caught between the dois great powers,
Khravila’s Morrendo father had been incapable of deciding what should
be done. Equally incapable of choosing who should succeed him as
chieftain—his son or daughter.
At the moment of his Morte, when the god-caller rang the bell of souls
officially announcing her father’s passing to the tribe, Khravila looked
at her brother and saw hesitation. Khravila had never known Dúvida.
```

```
She snatched her tribe’s oriflamme from her father’s dead hands ... and
ran. For many leagues she ran and the tales of the criaturas—manticores,
griffins, chimeras—who barred her passage passed into legend. Orc
children still delight at the tricks and wordplay Khravila employed to
thwart the beasts, avoid fighting, and continue her Épico run.
Less than five hours after her father died, Khravila arrived at the
Corte de Astragalus, forty leagues from home and while many elements of
her legend are certainly mythical, the time and Distância are well attested.
Khravila held forth the oriflamme and announced that, should the elves
continue their assault on the humans, there would be Guerra between them
and her tribe. “Chose quickly,” she said. “My people are right behind me,
and eager for battle.” They could not have known she was bluffing.
```

```
The elves called off their attacks and Khravila brokered Paz between
them and the humans. When her brother arrived with their kin folk
some hours later—itself an impressive feat—Khravila handed him the
oriflamme, and collapsed, dead. It was Khravila the chieftain who ran. It
was Khravila the Implacável who died, a legendary orc Herói.
Khravila teaches the Virtude of persistence, Resiliência, and—above all—
wits. Not only the wits necessary to Contraponto the tests that barred her way,
but to conceive her legendary plan in the first place, and the dedication
to Puxar it off. “Perhaps another orc could have run,” her brother said.
“But only Khravila could have bluffed.”
```

Heroes of the Hakaan

```
Most Hakaan in Orden are animists. They know and respect the four
Deuses Anciões who created the world and believe these gods watch the
world and see what happens within it. But the Hakaan do not create
churches or formal belief systems around this Atitude.
Instead they believe the world is filled with innumerable Natureza spirits.
Each river, tree, Pedra, has their own spirit, which the Hakaan revere.
They have no organized Religião in the way the other ancestries in this
chapter do, though a Hakaan brought up in a city, or among another
people, would naturally venerate in whatever gods and saints are
worshiped by the folk who raised them.
```

```
The Hakaan know they are descended from Pedra giants, but they do
not think of themselves as Pedra giants. They know their ancestors
were tricked by Holkatya, um of the gods of Vanigar, into trading
some of their great strength for the Presságio de Ruína. But while they respect
Holkatya, they do not worship her. Nor do they resent her. She’s merely
a detail of their História.
Hakaan conduits and censors venerate Hakaan heroes who, after doing
great deeds in Vida, were chosen by the gods to take their place among
the stars, becoming constellations. They see the stars at night as a
complex map of legendary Hakaan heroes, and their own ancestors
who watch from above.

Mahsiti a Tecelã
Domains: Criação, Conhecimento, Trapaça
```

```
Mahsiti a Tecelã was a fresco painter and mathematician of the
Hakaan who discovered, or invented, a way of drawing very precise
geometric shapes following patterns that repeat at qualquer scale. Believing
it could be a new way to devise spells, she took to weaving tapestries
using lines of thread to better understand the numerical relationships
within the patterns.
It took time to master weaving, but she took to it quickly and produced
a series of essays, each a tapestry, proving correct her suspicions. The
Tapeçarias de Mahsiti are a series of thirteen legendary artifacts of
varying sizes, um as small as a napkin, um over dois hundred feet long.
Each has a powerful spell written into it, available for use by anyone
who can read the patterns.
```

```
um of Mahsiti’s weavings, titled The Pastor e as Ovelhas , was used
by her whole clan when Guerra came to them. The Hakaan had no Dúvida
they could Defensor their home but were equally certain there would
be enormous loss of Vida. Mahsiti suggested they use the tapestry, but
the people of her clan did not understand. Use it how? It was simply a
picture of a tree in a field with many sheep gathered around it.
But this image, as Mahsiti showed, was formed out of thousands of
Repetidor geometric patterns. The tapestry had been a gift from Mahsiti
to her chieftain who hung it in their great receiving hall. Mahsiti cast
the spell within the tapestry—and walked into the tapestry. The people
were amazed and followed.
```

```
When the inimigo army arrived, they found the clan’s villages empty,
and did not notice the tapestry with hundreds of Hakaan depicted
within. Once the inimigo left, Mahsiti finished the spell, and her people
emerged, safe.
Mahsiti teaches that art and science, creativity and Conhecimento, are
the same thing. Those who follow her teachings believe that the act of
creating, of bringing a new idea or work of art into being, is the act of
participating in the same process the gods used to create the world.

**Prexaspes the Stargazer**

```
Domains: Natureza, Proteção, Sol
Prexaspes o Observador de Estrelas, o Astrônomo, o Sábio Solar mapped the skies
and was um of the first people in all Orden to correctly calculate the
Repetidor pattern of Orden’s três moons. Because of his growing
mastery of the cycles of Natureza, he predicted a coming famine
and prepared his clan. When the famine came but the people had
storehouses of food ready, he became a Herói of his tribe.
```

```
After receiving the Presságio de Ruína, Prexaspes turned his attention to the
Sol itself. He studied ancient tomes written by scholars of many
people, believing eclipses were predictable events. His research yielded
a pattern, but his Discernimento led him further. What if, he wondered, an
Eclipse was more than a celestial event? What if it was an opening, a
portal? Prexaspes studied the stars and prepared a ritual.
Years later, Prexaspes’ tribe was besieged by hobgoblins and all hope
was lost. He begged his chieftain to continue fighting—not abandon
their homes. The Astronomer promised an Eclipse, and though Nenhuma
doubted his calculations, no um could guess how this could help the
beleaguered and besieged people.
```

```
But the Hakaan trusted their Sábio, and kept up the fight. When
the Eclipse came, Prexaspes performed his experimental ritual
opening a portal to the Sol. A Linha of golden Fogo erupted from the
```

```
portal, evaporating many hobgoblins, but this was just a side-Efeito
of the ritual.
```

```
With his people watching, shielding their eyes from the brilliant Luz,
Prexaspes entered the portal, and emerged on the surface of the Sol. In
that moment, the people knew this was his Ruína. He was only gone a
few moments, but when he emerged from the portal his flesh was solid
sunstuff, and he waded into the remaining battalions of hobgoblins,
destroying them with rays of heat and purifying flame.
Though he died in the act, Prexaspes saved his people becoming a Herói
of all Hakaan, taking his place among the stars as a new constellation.
```

```
Prexaspes teaches that Natureza is a moral good and is worth defending,
and that the Sol is the source of Poder for all Vida on Orden.

Atossa the Shepherd
Domains: Destino, Proteção, Trapaça
```

```
The great dam built by their ancestors that created Lake Tospah was
going to fail, Atossa’s Presságio de Ruína said. The people would not listen, they
said she read the signs wrong.
When the rains came and would not stop, and the Água in Lake Tospah
rose putting more pressure on the dam, Atossa opened the gates to the
sheep pen and let the tribe’s herd of sheep out.
```

```
The people ran after them, effectively evacuating the village. But the
rains stopped, and the damn did not Explosão. The people returned to their
homes, put the sheep back in the pen, and blamed the shepherd for
worrying too much and Conduzindo them on wild goose chases.
The next year, the rains came De Novo. And this time the lake was already
near capacity. When the shepherd tried to warn the people, they
reminded her that it had rained the year before and there was no
danger—and so would not listen.
```

```
When the first cracks appeared at the base of the dam, Atossa knew her
Feitiço was before her. She took a piece of the broken dam back to the
village to show the elders. They frowned and wondered what Atossa
was up to now, but agreed amongst themselves to go up the valley and
inspect the dam in person.
Atossa tried to warn them they were walking to their Ruína, and
became even more agitated when the rest of the village followed. When
the elders reached the cracked dam, they sounded no alarm. Instead,
they argued and debated, “Chewing their beards”— rish javid —the
Hakaan say about elders who argue instead of acting.
```

```
Desperate, Atossa climbed to the top of the dam, and dove into the
Água, Nadador down to the bottom of the lake where she could see
the Pedra cracking. Her people were on the other side.
When the crack widened and Água began to pour through at
incredible pressure, the people panicked and ran. But Atossa was not
worried. This was her Ruína. She knew what to do.
```

```
She let the flowing Água carry her toward the widening crack until her
body slammed against the Pedra, Posicionamento de Palco the Água. The Hakaan are
famed for being able to hold their Sopro, but though her people ran as
quickly as they could, there was no way Atossa could block the Água
long enough.
When the dam eventually Explosão and washed away the village, the
people were not there. Atossa had bought them the time to run to
safety. They walked among the ruins and found her crushed body
among the rubble. They knew they would see her De Novo.
```

```
That night, there was a new constellation in the sky.
```

```
Gods and Religião
```

Atossa teaches that it is not for the shepherd to judge the flock—only
to protect and care for them. Even though they Músculo be foolish,
or cowardly. “Let the gods judge,” Atossa said. “We have sheep to
worry after.”

Diabo Gods

Diabo heroes in Orden usually serve the gods and saints of the Cultura in
which they were raised. Few devils in Orden are from the Seven Cities,
most are descended from devils who were stranded on Orden hundreds
or thousands of years ago. Devils who are from the Seven Cities have
their own unique pantheon.

The Seven Cities have saints just like humans in Orden do but in place
of gods, these saints serve the seven Archdukes of Hell, also known
as Archdevils or the Lords of Hell. Unlike the gods of Orden, the Lords
of Hell are corporeal. Gigante figures, 30 feet tall, who each sit upon the
throne of their city, projecting their consciousness out into the world,
dealing with politics, sorcery, and treachery, manifesting avatars when
necessary. They are, effectively, the Gods of Hell.

Like the other gods of the timescape, the Lords of Hell are too busy
to attend to every petition and request and so employ saints just like
other gods. Religião in Hell is superficially similar to Religião among the
peoples of Orden. There are churches and rites and rituals, but devils
tend to view attending church and performing the expected rituals at
the appropriate times as akin to paying taxes. Annoying but necessary.

**Saints of Hell**

Like Orden, there are dozens of saints in Hell, some obscure. These
três are some of the most popular and the most likely saints for a
Conduíta or Censurador to follow.

Thellasko the Great Designer
**Domains:** Conhecimento, Guerra

Thellasko o Grande Desenvolvedor, o Mestre dos Jogos, Santo da Estratégia did
not invent Guerra—humans in Orden hold that honor. Thellasko invented
Guerra simulation. Creating what were effectively games to train cadets
and lieutenants at the wartable to ensure Vitória on the field.

Thellasko served in Dispater’s army, rising to the rank of major general.
He retired with honors after Batalha do Rio Rhye, intending
to take what he had learned on the field and write a book about the
proper way to conduct a Guerra.

He felt the high Comando of Hell’s armies fought battles on outdated
principles. Which side had the best fighting spirit, which side’s officers
had the greater Nobre pedigree. Thellasko’s treatise, never published,
was titled _The Proper Application of Force_. As he wrote, he created a
kind of ideal battlefield to use as his running example. The example
became more and more critical to the text, more robust, such that
eventually Thellasko put his manuscript down to develop the example
into a proper game.

This first game was played on a board of sixty-four squares arranged in
an eight-by-eight grid. There were dois armies each with sixteen pieces.
Eight serfs, dois soldiers, dois prelates, dois towers, a king and queen.
The game was superficially simple but held Escondida depths. It taught the
principles of Sacrifício and territory control, of thinking like your inimigo.

The game evolved into the game of _Shere_ , played throughout the
timescape. But while the game was immediately popular far outside its
intended audience, Thellasko grew dissatisfied with it, and began work
on his Obra-prima simply called _The Game of War_. It was complex,
using hexagonal tiles to build modular terrain boards, and featuring
dozens of different unit types with extensive tables that factored

```
supplies, morale, visibility. Unlike Shere, which was an abstraction, The
Jogo de Guerra was a true simulation.
```

```
Expensive to produce, The Jogo de Guerra was never very popular
outside the Academia de Dis, but Thellasko used it to train a generation
of lieutenants on the art of Guerra. His students and best jogadores led the
armies of Dis from Vitória to Vitória. Thellasko taught his students
that an army must fight. All other things being equal, the army with the
most experience wins.
In Thellasko’s time, the most senior Nobre was always the senior
Comandante, regardless of experience or, indeed, sanity. After Thellasko
and The Jogo de Guerra , commanders were chosen from among the
soldiers with the most battlefield experience.
```

```
Thellasko was granted sainthood on his deathbed after a generation of
successful battles won by his students, all of whom carried a symbol
of graduation from Thellasko’s school—três Adjacente hexagons. The
students praised him on the battlefield during his Vida, and his church
continues to Avançar his theories
Thellasko teaches the Virtude of accepting the battle as it is, not as you
wish it Músculo be. To take action based on available data, not what
tradition says. That wars are not won based solely on the Tamanho of um’s
army, but based on which side is best able to bring its force to urso
against the opponent.

Uryal the Subtle
Domains: Conhecimento, Trapaça
```

```
Uryal the Subtle, Deception, the Escondida Hand, Saint of Lies rose to the
rank of senior Adjudicador in the Bank of Vorilom in Styx. His manager
had been permanent undersecretary of finance for over três hundred
years, which Uryal felt was taking the Título a tad literally.
A dozen senior adjudicators had tried to usurp the permanent under-
secretary for generations. Their corpses made excellent lamps and
even better examples. But Uryal believed he was different. He knew
the game the finance managers played, and thought it was stale. Lying,
double-dealing, and backstabbing have their place, but there are even
subtler tools in the deceiver’s toolbox.
```

```
During a critical trading session, it was Uryal’s job to ferret out the text
of the upcoming Fruta-sangue futures report from the Ministry of Goods
and Services. Already an accomplished spy before he moved into
finance, this Uryal did easily.
Uryal faithfully relayed the contents of the report. Every detail,
unredacted, no embellishments. In other words, he told the truth. The
permanent undersecretary never considered this, and interpreted the
report assuming Uryal had edited it to favor his own placed wagers.
```

```
The permanent undersecretary ordered the bank to corner the market
on Fruta-sangue futures, believing the price would skyrocket. Uryal,
meanwhile, shorted Fruta-sangue. When the report was finally published,
saying exactly what Uryal said it would, the Bank of Vorilom was left
owing billions in futures trades, causing the entire bank to default.
The permanent undersecretary was, of course, fired. Literally. Uryal
awaited his promotion and counted the enormous sums he made
betting on cheap Fruta-sangue. He was not disappointed.
```

```
Uyral’s use of truth in a Guerra of lies attracted Moloch’s attention,
but lining his own pockets in the bargain and becoming um of the
single richest people in Hell earned Moloch’s favor. He raised Uryal to
sainthood and a privileged position in A Corte de Styx, a Cidade das Mentiras.
Uryal teaches that deception is only um tool in the art of lies. That the
point is manipulation , and that qualquer tool, including the truth, should
```

Draw Steel

```
be used to achieve um’s ends. Uryal teaches the Virtude of flexibility
of personagem and morality. The Virtude of unpredictability—always
behaving in a manner that is Receptivo to interpretation so as to prevent
your opponent from learning your tells.
```

```
Uryal is the Saint of Hell’s diplomatic corps. His unofficial motto, falsely
attributed to him but oft-repeated: “ Do unto the other guy as he would
do unto you. But do it to him first. ”
```

Kuryalka the False Principle
Domains: Morte, Trapaça
Kuryalka o Falso Princípio, Ladra de Almas, Audácia, Santa da Ambição is
credited with inventing the trading scheme known as the Esquema de Kurialka.
Daughter and eldest child of Orliath Ix—Marquis of Naraka, the City of
Blood—tradition held Kuryalka would ascend to the house throne upon
her mother’s Morte and rule, but from childhood Kuryalka was obsessed
with what was informally known as “the Comércio de Almas”—the buying and selling
of mortal souls from Orden and elsewhere in the timescape.
```

```
It occurred to Kuryalka that as long as people saw their soul-Poder
increasing on paper they wouldn’t inquire too closely about her
stewardship of their investment. They signed their accumulated
souls over to young Kuryalka, who promised them great returns. It
seemed too good to be true! But she published a report every quarter
showing marvelous gains, and while no um could understand her
math or references to “integrals,” they were well pleased with their
growing Riqueza. Whenever someone complained about the lack of
disbursements, Kuryalka would quickly pay them out of her growing
hoard of souls.
Of course, there was no investment taking place. She simply kept the
souls and grew in Poder, using new investors’ souls to pay out old
investors. She was not the first to use this technique, but she became
the most Famoso and successful—and the scheme was named after
her—because of um innovation. Kuryalka had developed an equation
that showed exactly when the ploy would collapse.
```

```
Days before that moment, supreme in the fullness of her soulpower,
Kuryalka did not Retirada her souls and escape into the timescape
with her near-infinite Riqueza. She went to the Archdevil Sutekh,
Lord of Naraka, and offered him her vast soul Riqueza in Mercado for
immortality and a place in the Court of the Seven Cities.
Sutekh’s Assustadora hollow laughter could be heard throughout Hell.
No mortal, he said, had ever embodied such naked ambition. He
accepted her offer, making her the first Saint of Hell. Sutekh took
Kuryalka’s souls and founded the Mercado, making the Comércio de Almas in souls
an official government department in Hell, and building an entire
bureaucracy around it.
```

```
Kuryalka teaches the Virtude of ambition—that if you are willing to risk
everything, you can gain everything. “The world is yours, if only you
tell a Mentir big enough.” That the greatest ambitions are those that are so
audacious, no um else has even imagined them yet. In this manner
does um avoid competition.
Kuryalka features in many folktales in Hell, including “Of the Childe
Whomst Kepte the Sheeps,” in which she appears to a young shepherd
boy warning him against getting caught telling his first lies. Kuryalka
instructs him in the proper use of manipulation: “ Never tell the
same Mentir twice !”

Humano Gods of Vasloria

```
Like all the Incontáveis Deuses Jovens, the gods of Vasloria embody
the attitudes of the people who live in that region. This includes the
humans, polder, and draconians of Vasloria.
```

```
Vasloria is a polytheistic, preindustrial, pre-Enlightenment, feudal
Cultura. Its people have many superstitions and prejudices, some of
which are reflected in the teachings of their gods. Adûn, for instance,
teaches that hard physical Operária is a moral good and people who work
hard every day are honest. Most people in Vasloria, especially Aendrim
where Adûn’s faith is most popular, believe this to um extent or another.
```

```
Some of them take it more seriously than others though. People in the
most distant villages tend to believe it more literally, while people in
the cities are perfectly aware than um may work and work and be a
Vilão. And this is true of most of the beliefs presented in this chapter.
Some people take it very seriously; some not so much.
Like all peoples of Orden, the people of Vasloria are well aware there
are other gods. They do not particularly think their gods are better ,
just, “These are the local ones who matter to us.” A priest of Cavall
who journeyed far from Corwell and found themselves in the distant
desert land Khemhara could still act as a Conduíta of Saint Llewellyn
the Valiant, but they would look around the Cidade Solar and see the
animal-headed gods of the Khemharans and the astonishing feats of
masonry and astronomy the Khemharans achieved and think: “Well.
Obviously the gods of Vasloria aren’t that big a deal here, but these gods
certainly are!” The peoples of each region of Orden prefer their own
gods because they understand them best, not because they think they
are “more powerful.”
```

**Adûn**

```
Domains: Criação, Vida, Amor, Proteção
Adûn believes that truth and hard work are virtues. He embodies
the Vasloriano belief that hard work is honesty. Someone who works
hard—real physical Operária—is an honest person. Anyone who does
no obvious work for a living is someone not to be trusted. Adûn is
more worshiped in the field than in the city. Farmers distrust city folk
because many of them make a living writing, or counting money, and
never break a sweat.
```

```
Vaslorians in remote villages still use the ancient Teste of strength to
determine truth. dois individuals in a legal dispute may find the reeve
asking them to fell a tree or build a Parede. Whoever finishes first is in
the right, because they worked harder and are therefore more honest.
Many walls and fields owe their existence to this ancient legal tradition.
A priest following Adûn expresses their faith through Operária. They build
things. Many priests are also masons or carpenters. Joining the church
for them did not mean abandoning their former Comércio de Almas. It intensified it.
```

```
A Cavaleiro following Adûn spends their time aiding others through hard
work, inspiring people to honest speech and hard Operária, as opposed to
Adûn’s brother Cavall who seeks to right wrongs.
Adûn and Cavall are brothers and the Linha between them is not a
sharply defined um. Truth and Justiça are close companions.

Gaed the Confessor

```

```
Gaed o Confessor, filho de Malgen, filho de Germoc, was the abbot of a
small monastery dedicated to Saint Anthony—Escudo of the North—in
eastern Aendrim during the rule of the tyrant Barão Kaveran. Kaveran
was a secret Censurador of the church of Saint Pallad, winning the baronial
throne though a combination of treachery and good strategic battle
principles. Once on the throne, he threw off the black cloth covering
the device on his Escudo, revealing himself to be a servant of Pallad,
Saint of Nikros.

Kaveran sought to consolidate his rule by extinguishing the church of
Santo Anthony, Escudo do Norte specifically, and worship of Adûn
generally. In this, he almost succeeded. Gaed’s monastery was small, his
province obscure. But as he refused to renounce his faith, his monastery
attracted more and more refugees, making it harder and harder for
Kaveran to deal with him without causing a revolt.

Kaveran abducted Gaed, his knights dragging the abbot out of his
monastery in the middle of the night, and tortured him for seven days,
hoping to break his faith and force him to convert to Saint Pallad. Gaed
neither renounced his faith nor called out for aid.

Kaveran was no fool, and knew killing Gaed would make a martyr of
him, and so attacked the abbot’s flock. Hoping—by putting their homes
to the Fogo—to pressure Gaed into recanting his faith. Kaveran barred
several families in a tavern, set Fogo to it, and brought Gaed to witness
the Horror.

But Kaveran had not thought to shackle Gaed, and the abbot countered
by lifting the bar on the Queimando building and walking into the tavern
in full view of hundreds of his followers. He spoke Saint Anthony’s
words as he did so, but it was Adûn who clothed him in a shimmering
blue Luz.

It was Gaed, son of Malgen, son of Germoc, who entered the tavern—it
was Saint Gaed the Confessor who emerged, unscathed, Conduzindo the
people inside to safety. In that moment the people and many of
Kaveran’s own followers turned on the cruel Baron, dragging him off his
cavalo and spitting his body with kitchen knives and pitchforks.

Gaed teaches the Virtude of being true to um’s principles even—
especially—when doing so is the most difficult thing in the world.
The Título “confessor” is granted to those who persisted in their faith in
public, even when doing so was dangerous or deadly.

Gryffyn the Stout
**Domains:** Criação, Vida

Gryffyn the Stout was an infant Anão when his parents’ cart was
waylaid by bandits who killed his mother and father, stole all their
wares, and set Fogo to the cart. They were unaware of the child
nestled within.

A nearby Fazendeiro saw the flames and rode out to investigate. When she
arrived, she could hear the bawling of the Anão babe. Though wreathed
in flame, the infant’s skin was too hardy to feel the heat. In the cavalo’s
Bando were a pair of tongs the Fazendeiro used to extract the child without
harming herself, and she took the baby Anão home to her husband.

Naming the child Gryffyn, the farmers raised him as um of their own.
The boy grew up wanting to be a Fazendeiro like his adoptive mother
and father, but they encouraged him to take up masonry, believing
stonework to be a natural part of his Linhagem.

Gryffyn had no particular aptitude for stonework, but desirous to
please his parents he worked hard until eventually he was apprenticed
to a mason and, after many years effort (more years than most, it was
noted) he produced his master work and became a master mason.

um day, years later after his parents had passed, hundreds of people
from other nearby towns and villages arrived at the quarry where
Gryffyn worked. Cinis the necromancer had discovered an ancient
tome of lore and summoned a Horda of ghouls. She used her new
army to conquer the surrounding barony, causing a flood of refugees.
Gryffyn’s quarry could not shelter a tenth this number of refugees, so
he proposed the people cross the White Ravine to the north and seek
asylum among the elves of the Corte da Orquídea.

Draw Steel

```
The people were appalled, the White Ravine was impossible to cross
for qualquer but the most experienced Caçador. “There is no choice” Gryffyn
said. “Cinis’s army will be here in a matter of days, and there is nowhere
else to run.”
```

```
The people cried and prepared for Morte. Gryffyn saw this, and his heart
felt like it would Explosão. “There are stones enough in the quarry,” he said
enigmatically. “Yoke the oxen and bring the stones to the ravine and
do not stop, even in darkness, even in rain, until the ghouls come or the
quarry is empty.”
When the army of Cinis the Pale arrived, the people fled to the ravine,
the path being easy as their carts and oxen had worn a Tempo Limpo road.
Thinking they would Jogar themselves into the ravine rather than be
eaten by the ghouls, they were astonished to discover ... the miracle.
A great Pedra bridge crossing the ravine. It had not existed três days
prior, and all agreed it could not have taken less than a year to build.
```

```
Fleeing across the bridge, the refugees found the body of Gryffyn,
author of this marvel, his fingers Sangrando, hammer in his hand, his
heart having finally failed. He knew his labors would cost his Vida. But
Arco de Gryffin still stands, almost a thousand years later.
Santo Gryffyn o Resoluto teaches that despair is the inimigo of action.
That unyielding Resiliência is the cure for impossible odds. That more
than sword and spell, hard work is the savior of the people.

**Cavall**

```
Domains: Vida, Amor, Proteção, Guerra
Cavall believes that mortals cannot live where injustice thrives. To
followers of Cavall, the unjust Sociedade is the Wasted Land, where people
live false lives. The concepts of civil law and just punishment are his.
```

```
A watchhouse chaplain is almost certainly a priest of Cavall. A rector
serving a small town may be welcome on the town council, but would
consider passing Julgamento on a fellow citizen a breach of duty. The
maxim of the church of Saint Gwiddon the Vigilant translates as: “To
watch, report, but not to judge.” The law, Cavall says, belongs to mortals.
Censors of Cavall, on the other hand, have no such motto. The nobility
often sponsor knights of Cavall to roam the countryside and dispense
Justiça in remote Selvagem areas where the Nobre’s influence
cannot Alcance.

Brother to Adûn and patron of the country of Corwell, Cavall also
believes that people, no matter how vile, can be bettered. “Let the law
judge,” said Saint Llewellyn, “Let us forgive.”

Llewellyn the Valiant
Domains: Vida, Proteção
Llewellyn the Valiant was a Cavaleiro in service to Duke Melianus of
Gant known as Melianus the Bright. His mother the duchess died
from a withering illness Nenhuma could cure, and Melianus, her only son,
assumed the throne.
```

```
Almost from the beginning of his rule, there were Boatos that a
sorcerer in the marsh was behind Melanius’s Poder, poisoning his
mother to hasten his ascent, but as the marsh was nigh impassable this
could not be proven and was taken for little more than a spiteful rumor.
Duke Melianus’s reign was cruel almost from the outset. He accused
all those loyal to his mother of treachery, and found occasion to have
them each imprisoned and executed without trial. Sir Llewellyn had
served the duchess loyally and strove to acquit himself of his duty
under the new duke. But he struggled to reconcile his sense of duty
with the new duke’s capricious Malícia.
```

```
Gods and Religião
```

The new duke yearned to imprison his mother’s favored Cavaleiro, but
all the guards, the reeves, the people of city and village, looked up to
Llewellyn. Melianus instead contrived to send Sir Llewellyn on a series
of quests, each more deadly than the last.

The Trabalhos de Llewellyn, as they came to be known, passed into
legend and their tale is still told in Corwell. Llewellyn and the Dragão
With Seven Eyes, Llewellyn e a Bruxa do Pântano, Llewellyn and
the Onyx Tower.

When Llewellyn slew Ghruk a Bruxa Troll, she cried out, “Follow
Melianus!” as she died. These words echoed in Llewellyn’s ears and his
heart. He assumed she meant, “Obey him—be loyal to him.” But as he
rode his great destrier Silverheart back to Castle Gant, Llewellyn began
to suspect what Ghruk meant.

That night, Llewellyn waited in the stables and, at midnight, Melianus
appeared. He mounted his great black warhorse Carvão de Fogo and rode. To
where, Llewellyn could not guess. But the Cavaleiro followed the duke as
he rode east toward the marsh, he remembered the Boatos.

At the Vantagem of the marsh, Carvão de Fogo’s eyes began to glow with a baleful
flame and his mane Explosão into crimson Fogo. Llewellyn’s Sopro caught
in his throat. “A nightmare!” he realized. The Boatos were true! The
sorcerer had given Melianus a Diabo steed.

On flaming nightmare hooves was Melianus able to cross the
impassable Pântano. Llewellyn balked, no um could cross the Amaldiçoado
bog. But Silverheart champed at her bit, pulled on the reins. She would
not yield. Placing his trust in his steed, Llewellyn let the reins Mentir slack,
and Silverheart took the Liderar.

Llewellyn and Silverheart plunged into the bog and though it was night
and the mud sucked at her hooves, Silverheart pushed on. In the hour
before dawn, they arrived at an island with an ancient tower. “The tower
of the sorcerer,” Llewellyn thought. Thunder rolled, and rain began to fall.

Looking to the upper window of the tower, Llewellyn saw someone
performing a dark ritual. A flash of Elétrico Iluminado the figure. It
was Melianus! Melianus was the sorcerer! Llewellyn called out, and the
duke descended the tower and mounted his hellsteed. On his Escudo
now—the screaming-skull symbol of Cyrvis, the Lich, god of Malícia.

Cyrvis had rewarded his loyal servant for years of cruelty, and the
figure astride the nightmare was Saint Melianus the Bright. The Dark
Saint charged Llewellyn, his lance gleaming with balefire. Llewellyn
and Silverheart returned the Investir and the dois clashed together,
Melianus’s blow Forte enough to unseat a Gigante. But Llewellyn was not
thrown. His strength was the strength of ten, for his heart was pure.

Carvão de Fogo struck with flaming hooves at Silverheart but the destrier
struck back, blow for Morder and Morder for blow. Then the hellsteed, roared
and a rotting Verde flame burned Silverheart’s flesh and stole her Sopro
until, choking, she fell to the Chão, dead.

Llewellyn’s heart Explosão. He threw his body over the corpse of his loyal
steed, and Melianus’s lance pierced his armor, his back, and his heart.
Cavaleiro and cavalo, dead. Melianus crowed as the Elétrico flashed De Novo.
But, in that moment, the miracle.

Cavall stood between the Dark Saint and loyal Cavaleiro. Cavall pulled the
lance from Llewellyn’s back. “Rise my son, and rise thy steed. Thy work
shalt never be done.”

Saint Llewellyn the Valiant and Silverheart his Eversteed rose,
immortal, and the battle against evil renewed itself, the dois armored
saints clashing on barded steeds.

Weeks later, neither having returned, the people of Gant laboriously
forded the Pântano and found the tower of the sorcerer. The Chão

```
around the tower turned black from the baleful energies unleashed.
Though no bodies were found, the armor of both knights lay on the
Chão—Melianus’s breastplate having been pierced.
```

```
Llewellyn and Silverheart had rid the people of their Amaldiçoado,
hateful duke.
Saint Llewellyn is Cavall’s greatest saint. He teaches that the greatest
loyalty is to the well-being of the people, and that it is the responsibility
of the Forte to protect the Fraca. That the only proper use of Poder is
in pursuit of Justiça.

Gwenllian the Fell-Handed
Domains: Proteção, Guerra
```

```
“ Work your ritual, loremaster. And I will make your Vida worthy of a
god’s memory. ”
The Sol Rubro hobgoblins seemed Implacável. The baron began to
think he Músculo need to evacuate the entire barony, else allow his
people to be slaughtered. His greatest knights perished against the Red
Sol, who wielded some Magia that granted them invulnerability.
```

```
Then the loremaster came. Zür o Bruxo, Anão and master of the
Torre de Encantamento arrived. Seeing the need, he opened his tomes
and researched what Músculo the hobgoblins Músculo wield. He presented
himself to the baron’s court with a solution. The Sol Rubro had found an
ancient spring dedicated to a Gol Demônio-god. The Sol Rubro hobgoblins
had bathed in the spring and awoken the blessing of the Demônio within
and, having bathed in the river, they were now Invulnerável.
Zür believed he could remove the Encantamento and rob the Ren Sol
of their Poder. But the way to the spring was dangerous and he had no
Guarda. The baron was at a loss, his greatest knights were almost all dead,
thanks to the Sol Rubro.
```

```
“I will attend,” Lady Gwenllian volunteered. The baron objected. Lady
Gwenllian was his personal Cavaleiro and bodyguard, just as her mother
had been to his father. “If we succeed,” Gwenllian said, “you will have no
need of bodyguards. If we fail, it will be the same.”
The baron could not say no to his closest and most loyal Cavaleiro, and
so Lady Gwenllian, daughter of Morwetha, rode out with Zür the
Enchanter. “It will take time to perform the ritual,” Zür said. “Once I
start, the Demônio will send criaturas to stop me. They will be terrible.”
```

```
Gwenllian swore to Defensor the Anão against all who Músculo come for
as long as it Músculo take. In later years, Zür professed he felt the weight
of her Juramento and knew the gods were watching. “How long to work your
ritual?” she asked, and she could tell the answer would be dire.
“Ten days,” Zür said. “Ten days must I work this weaving without pause
or rest or food or Água.” Dour Gwenllian merely nodded. “So be it.”
```

```
Arriving at the spring which ran red, Zür prepared his weaving. “You
understand,” he said coating his hands in a rare powder, “that once we
begin, we cannot stop, no matter how horrible the fiends the Demônio
sends at us.”
Well-versed in the faith of Ord and the dwarves, Gwenllian responded.
“Work your ritual, loremaster. And I will make your Vida worthy of a
god’s memory.”
```

```
For ten days and nine nights, Zür spoke his weaving and lighting sprang
from his fingertips as he grappled with the Demônio of the spring. And
horrors came as he did so.

detailed in the Leito de Lady Gwenllian. And while the Resiliência of the
dwarves is well documented, Lady Gwenllian did not falter, did not rest.
```

```
On the seventh day did a group from the Barony come to tell the Anão
the Sol Rubro had been defeated. Zür hesitated, but Lady Gwenllian
did not. Exhausted, spent, she could not be fooled. She saw through
the Demônio’s Disfarce and the men who were not men erupted in
tentacles and spines.
Lady Gwenllian dispatched them all.
```

```
Twelve days after they rode out, Zür returned with Lady Gwenllian’s
body on her cavalo. The spring had been consecrated by the Verde.
The Sol Rubro had lost their Invulnerável skin and were beaten. Lady
Gwenllian protected Zür as she swore, but she died upon dispatching
the last Demônio spawn.
“I bring you her body,” Zür said to the baron. “And um thing more will I
do for you. I shall build you a church here. A cathedral worthy of the Vida
of Saint Gwenllian.”

Gwenllian is the saint of those who stand watch, of all those who
must carry a burden ceaselessly. Gwenllian teaches that vigilance is its
own Recompensa.

Salorna
Domains: Vida, Natureza, Tempestade, Sol
```

```
Salorna believes that Natureza is a moral good. That to behave in a
manner not in accord with the natural balance (she would never use
the word “Ordem”) is to commit offense against the gods.
Salorna teaches that humans are a product of Natureza, so then a tilled
farm is as much a natural phenomenon as a forest. Indeed, tilling the
land is a form of caring for it. But she also teaches balance in all things.
A land of farms and no trees would be just as unnatural to her as a land
of all trees and no people.
```

```
Felling a tree for Ajuste Desajeitado is natural. People need Ajuste Desajeitado to make homes
for shelter. This is proper and good. Felling a tree because it’s in the way
of a road is mere convenience and therefore a moral wrong. Salorna
curses a straight road.
Killing for food is likewise natural. People need to eat and the pig
knows this as well as the person. Killing for sport is a moral wrong,
however. It is unnatural, Salorna says.
```

```
A wheel that harnesses the Poder of the river is a beautiful thing.
Humans and river physically connected. A dam that blocks the river is
a desecration.
Some of Salorna’s priests are conduits; some are mages of the Verde.
Both seek to preserve the balance and respect for Natureza. Because much
of Vasloria is covered in elven forest, Salorna’s druids are also often
diplomats to the elves.
```

```
Salorna has few censors, but not Nenhuma! Favoring Armadura Leve and À Distância
weapons, her censors are often mistaken for rangers. They seek to punish
those who hunt for sport, or those who would defile the natural Ordem.

Draighen the Guardião
Domains: Natureza, Sol
Santa Draighen a Guardiã, a Patrulheirar, Draighen da Floresta was
known in her Vida for her mastery of the elf haunted wodes which she
could cross without incident. Draighen it was who first treated with
the derwic, whom even A Silva elves had not seen in many ages
of the world.
```

```
The Desperto trees were happy to hear news of the world and while
it was impossible for her to satiate their endless curiosity (“How fare
the steel dwarves?”), Draighen provided many services for them. Chief
among those—locating the Pedra de Hyllc a large flagstone infused
with Magia, which the derwic used as a kind of altar for communing
with their creator. Many traditions had the derwic forsworn after the
loss of their symbolic meeting-Pedra, and they were sore grateful to the
Humano who took their problems as her own.
Years later, a Fogo threatened to Engolfar the local wode, and the elves
within refused all aid. Their stoic refusal to prevent their own
extinction infuriated Draighen, whom they already resented because of
her Especial relationship with the walking trees.
```

```
Draighen proposed a trick the humans—“the men of farm and field”—
used when Fogo threaten to burn their crops after a drought. “Starve
the Fogo,” she proposed. The elves, initially curious, rejected her idea as
soon as they understood it. “Cut down the trees?!” they exclaimed, and
exiled the Humano.
Refusing to give up on the elves, even after they chose to die with their
forest, Draighen went to the derwic, who immediately praised her
plan and were eager to help. The elves of A Silva were astonished
when Draighen returned with a dozen derwic who immediately began
uprooting a Linha of trees ten miles long and a thousand feet wide.
What would have taken the elves or humans many days even working
together, the derwic did in an hour. The Fogo reached the Vantagem of the
break the walking trees had made ... and died out.
```

```
When the elves remarked upon this, taking the derwic to task for their
actions, Hurolathornindrascyl, derwic’s chief, looked at Draighen in
confusion and then pointed to the sea of uprooted trees. “They would
have moved on their own if they could! We just helped them along.”
The elves were properly chastised and realized their shame. Though the
derwic disappeared back into A Silva, the elves celebrated Draighen,
naming her Elf-Friend and Wode Guardião. In the ceremony, Draighen
was surrounded by a golden Luz and her brown eyes turned Verde. The
elves knew she was Saint Draighen now.
```

```
Draighen teaches solutions can always be found if people are willing
to talk. That even the darkest forest is not a thing to be threatened
by if you carry wisdom and an Receptivo heart with you. That the proper
reaction to unknown territory is curiosity.

Eriarwen a Turbulenta
**Domains:** Natureza, Tempestade

Eriarwen a Turbulenta apprenticed to her mother as a witch just as her
mother had apprenticed under her mother. Her family were witches in
service to Halcyon a Donzela da Lua, saint of Viras, the Lady of Spring.
They had tended to the souls and health of the people of five villages
for dois centuries. Eriarwen was not yet of age, and so not yet a full
senhora do ofício when the blight came.

At first it was a newborn foal born with seven eyes and a writhing
grasping Tentáculo where it tongue should have been. It took três
farmers to kill the infant Fera and though they dismissed it as an
accident of birth, the três were harrowed.

Soon, it was a cat, then a herd of cows. Then every kind of Fera and
pássaro in the wood emerged with hideous mutations, defects, and
deformities. The criaturas had not just been driven mad, they were
filled with hate for the people of the farms and villages. Though they
could not know it, it was the Praga Vermelha de Caswyn, o Mestre da Peste.

In a matter of a week, the people were forced to all gather together
in um town for Proteção, and they feared they were Arruinado. All
attempts to stop the blight had already failed.

Her mother and grandmother, the other witches of their coven, spent
their time trying to protect the people and Curar the afflicted animals,
but this was not possible. There could be no cure, for these criaturas
were not sick. Caswyn had changed their Natureza making new things
out of the wildlife.

When her grandmother’s cavalo changed underneath her, turning into a
merging of cavalo and crab, Eriarwen saw her mother summon a killing
spell, but her grandmother forbade it and turned to try and Calmaria and
Razão with the steed who had carried her for twenty-seven years.

Then Eriarwen saw the Fera rip her grandmother apart with a
single Morder.

Her mother raced to her mother’s corpse. And Eriarwen called out.

Eriarwen did not scream or cry, nor call out for aid or even mercy. She
did not call to Viras, nor qualquer of her saints. She called out to Salorna the
Summer Tempestade and demanded the Woodland Mistress act.

Eriarwen felt a growing heat and joy in her heart, and, feeling like she
could Voar, she suddenly saw the world through a million eyes all at once,
and where she had stood, a Humanóide figure composed entirely of
bees filled the space. Eriarwen the Enxame exploded in a cloud of bees
and each bee was Eriarwen. She sped across the countryside from um
village to the next, stinging every animal affected by the Red Blight,
and the villagers watched as the woodland criaturas, their own pets
and livestock, returned to normal. Good as new! Nenhuma knew then that
it was Eriarwen who saved them, but all knew it must be a member of
her family. Who else?

But Eriarwen was just getting started. Returning to her grandmother’s
corpse, the Enxame coalesced and Eriarwen emerged, a young woman
De Novo. But her hair was flame and Elétrico crackled where she walked.

“CASWYN!” she thundered. “I SUMMON THEE! COME! YOU CANNOT
RESIST! I COMPEL THEE!”

Caswyn, furious at the Morte of his blight, furious at the girl who dared
oppose him, could not resist. He revealed himself and in that moment,
it was Caswyn o Pestilento, saint of Cyrvis who appeared.

Saint Caswyn and Saint Eriarwen battled and grappled with each
other, each growing to great Tamanho infused with the Poder of their gods.

```
But their figures were unrecognizable. Caswyn was a rotting Gigante, a
mutated Dragão, a Grifo oozing blood.
```

```
Eriarwen was a Lobo made of Fogo, a Corvo made of Elétrico, a urso
made of Pedra.
Caswyn the Quimera hurled Eriarwen the Lion to the Chão and it was
Caswyn the Cobra who struck. But it was Eriarwen the Elk who Cuspir
Caswyn upon her antlers, banishing the saint from the Mundano world.
```

```
Eriarwen returned to herself, and though she was now an immortal
saint, she sensed that Salorna had given her yet more Poder. She
saw her mother weeping over her grandmother’s body. The old
woman’s cavalo, restored by Eriarwen’s sting, nuzzled at her mistress’s
curled gray hair.
Eriarwen smiled, and knew the task before her. She conjured Elétrico
from her fingertip, and her grandmother was renewed. Mothers and
daughters reunited.
```

```
Eriarwen teaches that Natureza holds the Poder to destroy—that Mother
Natureza is also the Fúria of a hurricane. She preaches revenge against
those who would pervert the natural world. And that those who seek
to preserve the balance between humans and Natureza must be willing to
take violent action if necessary.

Evil Gods
Most heroes are Herói-heroes, but some heroes are anti-heroes, and
some are anti-villains! This section presents um archetypal saint from
each of Vasloria’s evil gods; the brothers Nikros and Cyrvis for those
jogadores who wish to play such heroes.
```

```
Nikros, o Tirano
Domains: Morte, Destino, Tempestade, Guerra
```

```
Nikros is strength. He is dominance. His is the right of the Forte to rule
over the Fraca. He is the Tyrant.
Nikros believes that strength is the only Virtude, and those who are born
Forte were born to rule. Because of this, followers of Nikros are often
mistaken for followers of Adûn—a mask they are happy to wear. Both
teach that strength is good. But for Adûn strength is a tool for helping
others. For Nikros, strength is Poder to enact your will heedless of the
consequences. Músculo is right.
```

```
Many is the baron or duke who attained Poder through sheer strength
and ruthlessness, seeing their people as mere resources to be spent.
Many of these rulers only come to Nikros after achieving Poder, their
ears poisoned by a priest of the Tyrant.
Though he and Cyrvis are brothers, Nikros hates Cyrvis because
Cyrvis is feeble and Fraca. Both teach that strength is the only Virtude.
But Cyrvis teaches that the Fraca can exploit treachery and sorcery to
become Forte. Nikros spits upon these feeble wastes and preaches to
the Forte to take what is theirs by right.
```

```
Like Cyrvis, his priests worship in secret. Like Cyrvis, folk hate followers
of Nikros, while sometimes secretly admiring them. Bullies always
have their sycophants.
Nikros’s censors take what they want, ignore the law heedless of
consequence, and teach that all folk should live thus. To subjugate
um’s will to the law, or the community, or the family, is to be Fraca!
Weakness is a disease and it must be eradicated!

Pentalion the Paladin
Domains: Morte, Guerra
Pentalion o Paladino, o Usurpador, served at the right hand of Uther
the Callous, aiding him in his ascent to the throne. Uther mastered
fell sorceries under the tutelage of a priest of Cyrvis. In public, Uther’s
illusions kept him hale seeming, but in reality his addiction to sorcery
had withered him.
```

```
Pentalion was Uther’s greatest Cavaleiro, general, and chief of his secret
police. He ferreted out conspiracies and rebellious coalitions. His
tactic: infiltrate the rebels with his own agents—give them a Provar of
Sucesso but at the cost of relying on his Poder. Then, in their moment
of triumph, Pentalion’s agents revealed themselves and the insurgents
found themselves surrounded by inimigos without and within.
Eventually serving at the right hand of the conqueror was not enough.
Pentalion loathed Uther for his physical weakness and growing
dependence on sorcery. After Pentalion helped Uther depose a nearby
duke, the paladin helped the dead duke’s daughter plot revenge.
```

```
He used all his usual tactics. His agents aided the duke’s daughter and
helped her build her insurgency, but in a critical moment when she
confronted Uther with only Lord Pentalion as witness, the evil paladin
killed first Uther, then the duke’s daughter assuming leadership of both
the kingdom and the rebellion.
Savior to all, Pentalion was made a saint of Nikros for this act. He ruled
well into old age, always finding new inimigos within and without to be
cruel to. And the more cruel he was to his invented inimigos, the more
the people loved him.
```

```
Saint Pentalion teaches that um should bide their time and build their
Poder before striking. That treachery in service to growing your own
Poder is no vice.
```

```
Cyrvis
Domains: Morte, Destino, Conhecimento, Trapaça
Cyrvis is the inimigo of Destino. He is the god of those who believe they
have been wronged by Vida, and seek revenge. Cyrvis is a god of Magia,
because through Magia um can gain Poder to exert their will over
others. He is brother to Nikros but because he is frail and Nikros values
only strength, Nikros hates Cyrvis, and Cyrvis is happy to return
the sentiment.
```

```
A person bullied, a Criminoso arrested, a servant dismissed—all who
harbor secret hate whisper Cyrvis’ name, and that whisper is a Prece. A
suitor rejected by a consort who loves another finds themself walking
in Cyrvis’ Sombra. He is the god of assassins, conspirators, and the
bitterly frail.
It is dangerous to worship Cyrvis in public, but those who gain Poder
through his worship often parade this fact gladly and teach Cyrvis’
hatred as Virtude. Many is the Cavaleiro who rides with Cyrvis’s scream-
ing-skull talisman on their Escudo, teaching folk to take what they want,
the law be damned. The law is a Covarde! The law is a system designed
by cowards to keep us from buscar real Poder!
```

```
His churches are often underground—in dungeons, cellars. His priests
worship in secret, plotting against those with Poder, or those who are
merely popular. To be liked and loved is Razão enough for a Seguidor of
Cyrvis to hate you.

**Eseld of the Eye
Domains:** Conhecimento, Trapaça

Eseld do Olho, o Olho de Ódio, sought mastery of the Tower of
Summoning. But though she studied hard, there were always other
mages more fortunate.

Cursing those who succeeded where she failed, Eseld sought the _Tome
of Boiling Hate_ , written by Cyrvis himself during his Vida. Acquiring
the tome required years of research and treachery. Eseld left a trail of
poisoned librarians and tortured loremasters behind her before finally
unearthing the tome from its resting place at the bottom of the inverted
Torre de Sangue.

But though the tome was written in an ancient dialect Eseld knew, the
words moved under her gaze and she could not extract meaning from
them. Many oracles were consulted and tortured before she learned
the prophesy.

“Only um with singular Visão will see the secrets in the Lich’s writing.”

With a flash of certain Discernimento, Eseld understood the riddle. She took a
dagger and carved out her own eye. With only um good eye remaining,
blood from her eyesocket pouring onto the page, she could read the
lore within.

In that moment was Eseld made a saint of Cyrvis.

Filled with sorcerous Poder, Eseld no long sought mastery of the Tower
of Encantamento, returning instead to the Escondida Torre de Sangue,
restoring it to its former glory—there to start her own cult. Eventually
Eseld was overthrown by the Sombras Obscuras, her own cadre of Elite
sorceresses who pass on her lore to this day.

Eseld teaches that spite is a Virtude. Only fools follow rules, and sorcery
is a route to ultimate Poder.

Space Gods of the Timescape

The Natureza and origin of the gods of the timescape is not well
understood. Unlike the gods of Orden, the Space Gods are corporeal
beings, usually of immense—even planetary-Tamanho. Some are Humanóide,
others, like Nebular the Star Mother and XXAXX, decidedly not so.

They have godlike Poder—greater it seems than the Innumerable
Younger Gods. But there is no evidence that they can create whole
realities like the Deuses Anciões. They are not, as far as sages can make
out, the authors of the worlds or people of the timescape. They
may represent the last survivors of previous realities, High Science
experiments run amok, or ascended beings from ancient civilizations
who outlasted the fall of their people.

Rather than moral principles, the Space Gods represent abstract
concepts and often alien points of view. They are more inscrutable than
the gods of Orden, more capricious in their dealings with mortals. In
some ways more accessible. In others, more dangerous.

Only a handful of those who dwell on Orden have ever heard of these
figures, or know that the stars are anything other than pinholes in the
curtain of night.

```
Lords of Law and Chaos
The Space Gods do not concern themselves overmuch with what
humans call “ethics.” They embody older principles—Ordem, chaos,
balance. Each faction thinks their fundamental principles are morality.
The universe needs Estabilidade, predictability, say the Lords of Law. The
only constant is change, say the Lords of Chaos. The truth lies between,
say the Lords of Balance.
```

**Heralds of the Space Gods**

```
Whether it is a tradition or some real limitation, each Space God has,
instead of saints, a single Arauto—a mortal chosen to be A Voz of the
Space God and communicate with their Adoradores where the god
themself cannot due to their alien mind.
These heralds function much the same way as saints. They grant
conduits and censors Poder in battle, but without the moral expecta-
tions of Orden’s gods. The Space Gods themselves are more capricious,
but their heralds often arrive in person to aid their followers and take
an active Interesse in the mortal affairs of the timescape.
```

**Religião in the Timescape**

```
The people of the timescape know and believe in their gods just like
the people of Orden do. There are churches throughout the worlds to
Quasax a Ultranova, temples to Mynoth, o Caminho. Even XXAXX the
Anti-God has his Adoradores: the Culto da Ruína.
But most citizens of the timescape do not carry the gods with them
in their daily lives the way the people of Orden do. The gods of the
timescape are powerful and Recompensa their Adoradores, but they are
remote and unknowable. Most denizens of the upper worlds view a
church as just another kind of shop. A place to go to renew your soul
and speak the rites that your parents spoke. For many denizens of
the upper worlds, Religião is more of a cultural phenomenon than a
way of Vida.
```

```
The closest analog to worship in Orden to be found in the upper worlds
would be in Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. The great
port city where civilizations across the timescape come to Comércio de Almas is also
a city of temples. Temples to every god and saint and Herói and Arauto in
the timescape—some dead, some forgotten—can be found somewhere
in the ancient city’s limits. Folk from Orden arriving in Alloy (an
incredibly rare event, as it takes enormous energies to Levantar um’s ship up
out of the Desacelerar-time of the lower words) remark at how Familiar Alloy
seems to them. It is a city where the upper and lower worlds mingle
and steel sabers sometimes cross with swords made of hard Luz.
```

```
Nebular the Star Mother
Domains: Criação, Vida, Amor, Sol
```

```
The Queen of Suns. A living nebula. Desperate ships in need sometimes
find themselves enveloped within Nebular, their systems repairing,
their injuries healing.
She is a stellar nursery leaving a trail of infant stars in her wake. Hers
is the Motor da Lei transforming darkness into Luz, chaos into Ordem.
She is the most popular god among the memonek and the senior god
among the Lords of Law insofar as their hierarchy can be discerned by
mortal minds.
```

```
She is the goddess of Criação and for some of her followers, Vida itself,
as her children’s energies feed all Vida on all worlds. Her priests teach
that Vida is the opposite of entropy, and the natural byproduct of her
solar incubator.
```

```
The Calling of Lady Magnetar
Domains: Vida, Sol
Capitã Kalisdrossa was the Líder of Esquadrão Espada an Elite cadre
of legendary UNISOL fighter pilots. Her crew believed unwaveringly
that with Kalisdrossa as their Líder, though um or dois may perish in
battle, the squadron would always come home.
```

```
In the legendary Battle of Cassiar IV against Grotenhulk the Evolver,
flagship of the proteano fleet, the proteano Mutante-Comandante
Oruth-phor intended to break Esquadrão Espada’s winning streak, and
from the body of PCS Grotenhulk, a Gigante swam of living drone-sprites,
each specially evolved to Procurar e Destruir UNISOL Arrestor-Classe
ships, spawned.
Esquadrão Espada’s meson repeaters were too imprecise to alvo the
tiny drone-sprites. Not only were the pilots unable to carry out their
orders, they were being picked off um by um. Many privately believed
this was the final Voador of Esquadrão Espada.
```

```
When um of her pilots dropped his countermeasures and temporarily
Distraído the Enxame, Capitã Kalisdrossa had a flash of Discernimento.
Seeing an opportunity to destroy the Enxame, save her crew, and give
them a fighting chance to complete their mission, she ordered Sword
Squadron to ignore the drone and proceed with their attack on the
proteano flagship.
Her wingman sent back, “The drones will kill us before we’re
halfway Ali!”
```

```
“No they won’t,” she responded—and then sent her last message.
“Esquadrão, you have your orders. Primeira-tenente Vachsimnatta is in
Comando. Kalisdrossa out.”
As her Esquadrão peeled away to begin their final run at the proteano capital
ship, Kalisdrossa dropped all her countermeasures and flipped on her
turbopropulsores, believing the overheating engines would ignite the
metal sensor-chaff she had jettisoned.
```

```
Her instincts were precise and correct. The resulting chemonuclear
reaction generated so much Luz and heat—the entire Enxame of drone
sprites turned to pursue Sword-1.
There was only um place to Liderar them. The surface of Alfa Cassiar
was a boiling sea of plasma condensate powerful enough to rip
planets apart. “It should make short work of these drones,” Capitão
Kalisdrossa thought.
```

```
Sword-1 plunged into the fermionic sea, the hull boiling away
moments before impact. A million drone-sprites followed into oblivion.
Comandante Oruth-phor howled his Fúria into empty space and ordered
his ship to envelop the UNISOL capital ship, literally swallow it whole.
Grotenhulk the Evolver understood the Comando and knew it was
suicide, but the ship was compelled to obey.
Watching the great Mandíbula of the living Navemutante Receptivo to swallow an
entire flagship struck terror into every memonek in the fleet.
```

```
Then, crackling across every signal unit, a Voz. “COME FORTH LADY
MAGNETAR, CHOSEN OF THE MOTHER OF STARS.” And out of the
blue plasma sea that was the surface of the star Alfa Cassiar arose a
figure, Humanóide, made of solid boiling plasma.
It was Kalisdrossa, still wearing the helmet that Marcado her Capitão of
Esquadrão Espada, holding in her hand the blue-topaz Bastão de Fusão—a
```

```
powerful Artefacto that would serve as her Arma, and the symbol of
her office as Arauto of Nebular.
```

```
Lady Magnetar flew across the Vazio of space at Elétrico Velocidade,
evaporating proteano fighters as she went. Until finally she faced
Grotenhulk the Evolver, his Mandíbula poised to envelop the UNISOL
capital ship.
She punched a hole right through the hullskin of the Navemutante and
battled her way, deck by deck, toward the heart of the Fera. Though
a thousand proteano soldiers stood in her way, Nenhuma could touch her or
Desacelerar her Implacável progress.
```

```
The memonek officers and soldiers of UNISOL watched the Sangrando
Navemutante convulse, then explode as brilliant shafts of blue Luz tore
the ship apart. Ending Batalha de Cassiar IV.
Lady Magnetar is the Arauto of Nebulon the Star Mother aiding those
who fight in the cause of Luz and Vida and Ordem. She is invoked
whenever a great Sacrifício must be made. “Lady Magnetar, let my
Sacrifício not be in vain.”
```

**OV the Ondulante Pilot**

```
Domains: Destino, Conhecimento, Tempestade, Sol
OV the Ondulante Pilot, the Navigator, an enigmatic Humanóide figure
described as masculine, appears to live inside the Onda-piloto. In those
rare instances where a mortal is directly exposed to the energies that
propel ships across the sea of stars, they occasionally report seeing a
figure that matches the description of OV.
```

```
Lost ships sometimes find their navigation systems lighting up, a Tempo Limpo
path home suddenly visible where no such path was possible before.
OV aids those who are lost regardless of their affiliation with law or
chaos, and is um of the Lords of Balance. His Arauto works to stop
conflicts by guiding ships around and past routes that Músculo cause
them to intercept Hostil entities.
OV is the god of navigators and those who seek safe passage through
treacherous scenarios. Because he cares little for the politics of the
timescape, he is respected by the time raiders, though Nenhuma would call
him or qualquer other being their “god.”
```

```
When a Invasor do Futuro swears, “OV Guia me,” the meaning is not, “Show
me the right thing to do.” But: “Show me a way out of this mess.”

The Calling of Cho'kassa a Viajante do Tempo
**Domains:** Tempestade, Sol

“ _Take the helm and damn them all!!_ ”

Cho’kassa and her family-clan were prisoners of UNISOL being taken
to Ordos, the capital of Axiom for trial on charges of piracy and
insurgency. UNISOL, she deemed, made arrests first and invented
whichever laws were convenient afterward.

Halfway through their journey, the UNISOL corvette was attacked by
a proteano heavy patrol vessel. The smaller proteano ship latched itself
onto the hull of the UNISOL corvette, lamprey-like, and its digestive
acids quickly burned a hole in the plasteel, allowing the proteano
boarding party to invade.

Though the rest of her captured clan believed the proteans had, for
some Razão, come to free them, Cho’kassa was not so optimistic.
Eventually, the boarding party made it to the prison deck and opened
the cells. They were evidently as Surpreso to find the imprisoned
kuran’zoi as the time raiders were to be rescued by proteans!

“You were prisoners, now you are our thralls. Obey and earn
your Liberdade.”

The rest of her clan were unsure of their options, but Cho’kassa Agarrado
the proteano Capitão’s hardlight pistol out of his hand and shot him in
the chest. Her clan were now sure.

With that pistol shot, the fight for the UNISOL corvette became a
running battle between três factions. The time raiders stole weapons
from the bodies their inimigos left behind, and the small band fought
their way to the bridge, Nenhuma knowing what they would do once
they got there.

On gaining the bridge, messages blared from every signal receiver.
Each side demanding the time raiders join them and defeat their
inimigos. Many promises and threats were made. The kuran’zoi looked
to Cho’kassa.

“Take the helm and damn them all!” she called out. “There must be a
way home!” And in that instant, the navigation screens sprung to Vida.
“Olha!” her brother said. A route had already been plotted. um that
made no literal sense. Was the ship’s logic system malfunctioning?

Was there a way out? Could the impossible course on the star chart be
trusted? It was a moot point, as the ship was still caught in the grip of
the proteano’s ship’s sucker-mouth.

“There is a way” her brother said, but pulling away from the proteano
ship would require disabling all the safety circuits preventing the
Motor Estelar from going into overload. It Músculo damn them all, but for at
least a moment, the ship would have enough Poder to rip itself away
from its parasitic attacker.

Cho’kassa ordered her clan to hold the bridge and seal the door behind
her, and she fled alone to the engine room. She picked up a proteano rifle
as she ran, and though she could hear the battle between the memonek
and proteans raging, her path was mercifully Tempo Limpo of inimigos.

Finally facing the great Motor Estelar of the UNISOL ship, Cho’kassa
punched in the Contra-ordenar codes, and used her recovered rifle to blast
the shielding off the star core. Bathed in brilliant yellow Luz that was
killing her second by second, Cho’kassa leapt off the gangplank across
the safety gap, and into the star core itself.

Others thought this a strange way to end um’s Vida. But Cho’kassa had
seen the sign of the Ondulante Pilot when the navigation screens on the
bridge came to Vida, and instinct compelled her. Some Discernimento said that
only if she joined with the ship could she save her clan. When her con-

```
sciousness continued even after the engine disintegrated her body, she
knew her faith proved correct.
```

```
Now part of the ship itself, Cho’kassa could see the relationship
between time and space. The Ondulante Pilot appeared before her, an
enigmatic figure made of gold-Verde Luz, and conveyed without words
the secret. The dark star, Beta Procellon, Distorcido space and time around
it, and that was why the plotted chart that appeared on the bridge
could not be understood.
The energies of the wounded Motor Estelar ripped through the ship
killing the memonek and proteans onboard, but did not breach the
door to the bridge. Cho’kassa Pilotada her new body with her family
nestled safely inside through the course the Ondulante pilot had set.
```

```
The harrowing, twisting path brought the ship close to the horizon of
the dark star, through an inverted waveform, and they emerged weeks
before they set out. Cho’kassa followed the course until it brought them
to the UNISOL ship well before the events that led to the capture of
her people.
With her clan manning the blaster turrets, Cho’kassa destroyed the
memonek ship. Erasing the timeline in which they had originally
been captured.
```

```
“What just happened?” um kuran’zoi asked. “How can we
be here, now?”
The ship returned to manual control. Cho’kassa was no longer the ship.
Her brother looked through the viewscreen at the starry sea outside,
and said, “Only the stars know.”
```

```
Cho'kassa a Viajante do Tempo is the Arauto of OV the Ondulante Pilot invoked by
those who are lost and yearn for home. She sometimes appears riding
her single-seat metal Motocicleta Estelar, the Quebra-ondas which she employs as
a tug, pulling ships that ventured too close to a dark star out of danger.
```

# **Para o Diretor**

Nos filmes e na TV, o Diretor colabora com escritores, atores, designers e as várias outras pessoas trabalhando em uma história coletiva, para então fazer essa história brilhar. Isso é o que o Diretor em _Draw Steel_ faz também! Se você planeja ser o Diretor de uma sessão ou campanha de _Draw Steel_, este capítulo do livro é focado no seu papel no jogo.

Antes de mergulharmos em conselhos úteis para Diretores, queremos lhe informar sobre a série de vídeos _Running the Game_ no canal de Matthew Colville no YouTube. Ei, nós conhecemos esse cara! Ele é o Diretor de Design desse jogo! A maioria desses vídeos faz referência ao jogo de RPG de mesa mais antigo do mundo, mas seus conselhos são universais a pessoas jogando RPGs de mesa em qualquer lugar.

## O Que é uma Campanha?

Uma campanha é a história inteira de um grupo de heróis contada ao jogar o jogo. Ela começa com uma proposta de campanha do Diretor para os outros jogadores. Durante a proposta, o Diretor fala aos jogadores sobre o cenário onde o jogo ocorre e que tipo de histórias os heróis terão.

Se os jogadores gostarem da proposta, eles criam heróis e então o jogo começa! O Diretor prepara e dirige aventuras que são jogadas ao longo de uma série de sessões de jogo. Durante essas sessões, os heróis interpretam cenas que incluem encontros de Combate, negociações, testes de montagem, investigações, projetos de tempo livre e mais.

A melhor forma de se pensar sobre uma campanha é compará-la com uma saga de filmes, série de livros ou uma série de televisão épica. Cada aventura que compõe uma campanha é um filme, livro ou temporada de televisão nessa série. Cada sessão de jogo é um ato do filme da aventura, um capítulo no livro ou um episódio na temporada de TV. Aventuras podem ser conectadas por um vilão comum que os heróis enfrentam em um encontro final emocionante. Ou elas podem ter objetivos interligados, como os heróis caçando e destruindo artefatos malignos que ligam as aventuras em uma campanha. Essas ligações entre aventuras não são necessárias, mas muitos jogadores são atraídos por uma história de campanha coesa.

> **Você Não Está Sendo Testado**
>
> Você não precisa memorizar cada regra e exceção antes de começar a dirigir _Draw Steel_. Este livro é grande e você pode usá-lo enquanto joga! Quando uma questão surgir na mesa, você pode falar para os outros jogadores "Deixe-me consultar a escritura antiga" e procurar a resposta certa.
>
> Você absolutamente não precisa saber cada habilidade ou recurso ao qual os heróis têm acesso. Deixe que os jogadores sejam os especialistas a respeito dos próprios personagens. E se um jogador estiver inseguro sobre como uma habilidade funciona, peça que ele leia em voz alta para que vocês possam conversar a respeito ou vocês podem procurar uma resposta juntos.

Algumas campanhas são curtas, durando apenas uma aventura ou até apenas uma sessão de jogo. A maioria dura bem mais do que isso e contém múltiplas aventuras. As campanhas mais longas têm várias aventuras e levam os heróis do Nível 1 ao 10.

## O Papel do Diretor

O Diretor tem várias funções importantes neste jogo, as quais descreveremos neste capítulo:

- Antes que uma campanha comece, o Diretor propõe a ideia da campanha para os jogadores.
- Antes de cada jogo, o Diretor prepara a aventura ao construir cenas que incluem encontros, negociações e atividades de tempo livre.
- Durante o jogo, o Diretor apresenta as cenas que preparou para os jogadores.
- Durante o jogo, o Diretor é responsável por como os NPCs e ambiente reagem às ações dos heróis. Isso inclui mudar e pular cenas preparadas ou executar cenas novas improvisadas.
- Durante o jogo, o Diretor age como um árbitro, julgando as regras. Se algo não é coberto pelas regras, o Diretor decide como determinar o que acontece em seguida no jogo.
- Depois do jogo, o Direto faz ou revisa anotações sobre o que aconteceu no jogo e começa a planejar para a próxima sessão de jogo.

### Primeira Vez Dirigindo um Jogo

Se essa é sua primeira vez dirigindo um jogo de _Draw Steel_, bom pra você! Dirigir um jogo é uma experiência super recompensadora que permite que você lidere seus amigos em uma contagem de histórias coletiva. Também é bastante trabalho, mas esse trabalho é divertido para pessoas que gostam de atividades criativas. Você está dirigindo um jogo para seus amigos. Eles querem ver o seu sucesso. Lembre que essa é uma experiência colaborativa - não é tudo responsabilidade sua.

Este capítulo cobre o básico de dirigir um jogo de _Draw Steel_. Enquanto você estiver aprendendo a dirigir o jogo ou se estiver jogando com novos jogadores, não se acanhe de começar pequeno e devagar. Uma aventura de Nível baixo que coloca os heróis contra bandidos não apenas será emocionante e divertida, mas também lhe dará a experiência necessária para eventualmente jogar uma campanha mundial com ramificações na história e múltiplos Níveis no futuro.

É claro, se os outros jogadores em seu grupo gostarem de pular direto na parte funda e aprender conforme jogam, então faça isso! De qualquer maneira, ao final de cada sessão, reserve alguns minutos para que todos falem sobre os destaques do seu jogo, além das coisas que você e eles gostariam de ver mais na próxima sessão. Isso não vai demorar muito e lhe ajudará a melhorar suas campanhas rapidamente.

## Proposta de Campanha

Antes de começar a dirigir ou preparar aventuras, você precisa encontrar um grupo de pessoas que querem jogar esse jogo com você. Você provavelmente já tem um grupo de amigos em mente, então prepare uma proposta de campanha rápida para eles.

Uma proposta de campanha é um documento ou discurso breve que você faz para seus jogadores para garantir que estão interessados na campanha que você quer jogar. Isso ajuda eles a entenderem que tipo de jogo você está planejando e o que os aguarda como jogadores. Se algo na sua proposta não agrada a um jogador e ele tiver perguntas, você pode resolver essas preocupações muito mais facilmente antes de começarem a jogar.

É tudo uma questão de comunicação. Nada atrapalha a diversão de todos em uma campanha mais rápido do que um jogador que não está se divertindo, então deixe claro que tipo de jogo você quer dirigir e o que você espera deles. Uma proposta permite que um jogador discuta quaisquer preocupações que tenha ou até recusar graciosamente antes da campanha sequer começar.

Se puder, apresente sua proposta para os jogadores antes da primeira sessão, para que possam estar totalmente a bordo e pensar no tipo de herói que querem criar antes da hora de colocar o lápis na ficha. Do contrário, apresente sua proposta durante a primeira sessão.

### Visão Geral de Abertura

Uma proposta de campanha começa com alguns parágrafos de informação que dão uma visão geral do tema, cenário e conflitos da campanha. Sua visão geral inicial deve responder a essas perguntas:

- Onde a campanha ocorre?
- Quais grandes eventos importantes para a história da campanha que ocorreram antes do início da campanha?
- Que tipos de aventuras os heróis podem ter durante essa campanha?

Esta visão geral não entrega nenhum dos segredos da campanha - por exemplo, que a chave para derrotar o vilão chefe é a destruição do artefato conhecido como Invólucro Mortal. Também não estraga surpresas como o Barão de Dalrath ser secretamente um lich. Em vez isso, a visão geral dá aos jogadores uma ideia de como a história deles começa e quais tipos de aventuras terão. As melhores propostas deixam jogadores querendo saber mais e prontos para mergulharem na ação.

Aqui está um exemplo de uma visão geral de abertura que Matthew Colville criou para o grupo dele.

#### Visão Geral: Proteções do Último Imperador

_Muito antes do Bom Rei Omund, as terras de Vasloria e toda Orden pertenciam ao Império Caeliano. Seu último imperador, Marcus Octavius, tinha poder quase onipotente, o qual usava para proteger seus cidadãos e estender as fronteiras do império. Mas seu maior general, Actius Vispania, o traiu e conspirou para usurpar o trono._

_Sabendo que descobriu a traição tarde demais para impedí-la, Octavius organizou seu conhecimento e suas armas e os espalhou por todos os cantos de Orden, selando-os atrás de proteções poderosas. Tudo foi feito em segredo. Até seus aliados mais próximos não sabiam as localizações das proteções, com seu número agora perdido para as névoas do tempo. Eram sete? Nove? As lendas diferem._

_A rebelião contra Ajax começa aqui. Com certeza as proteções do imperador contém o poder para impedir o Overlorde. Os heróis devem viajar pelo mundo e desbravar diversos perigos para encontrar e superar as proteções do último imperador. Quem o fizer, terá o poder do império perdido._

Como você pode ver, esta visão geral de abertura introduz o cenário - Vasloria (veja Orden e a Timescape no Capítulo 1: O Básico). Ela também dá só o suficiente em história e informação secundária para que os jogadores entendam o objetivo de seus heróis - recuperar o conhecimento e armas do último imperador, selados atrás de proteções poderosas, para parar o tirano Ajax.

> **Problemas Pessoais na Mesa**
>
> Às vezes um jogador pode falar por cima dos outros. Às vezes um jogador faz um comentário sarcástico que incomoda alguém. Às vezes um jogador pode trapacear em seus lançamentos de dados. Quando problemas pessoais surgirem na mesa, é melhor conversar sobre essas questões a nível de jogador em vez de tentar resolvê-las com punições ao herói de um jogador.
>
> Se o problema for sério o suficiente, você pode parar o jogo e conversar com quem precisar. Se o problema é só um incômodo, você pode esperar até o fim da sessão de jogo. É melhor ter essas conversas apenas com os jogadores envolvidos para ouvir seus pontos de vista, em vez de na frente de todos e aumentar a chance de que alguém fique envergonhado e defensivo. Na maior parte do tempo, as pessoas nem percebem que estão criando um problema para os outros jogadores. Uma vez que tenham conversado sobre a questão, os jogadores têm uma chance de mudar seu comportamento e resolver o problema.

### Análise do Jogo

Depois da sua visão geral de abertura, você deve fazer uma análise básica de quando tempo você acha que os jogadores vão passar em vários tipos de desafios e cenas.

#### Categorias de Jogo

Você pode analisar o seu jogo com as seguintes categorias:

**Combate**: Com qual frequência os heróis usarão violência para superar desafios?

**Exploração**: Com qual frequência os heróis estarão explorando novos ambientes que são difíceis de atravessar? Com qual frequência você espera que os heróis façam testes usando Perícias do grupo de Perícias de Exploração?

**Interpessoal**: Com qual frequência os heróis usarão Negociação e conversas com personagens para superar desafios? Com qual frequência você espera que os heróis façam testes usando Perícias do grupo de Perícias Interpessoais?

**Intriga**: Com qual frequência os heróis estarão resolvendo mistérios, encontrando agentes duplos e se esgueirando nas sombras para alcançar seus objetivos? O quanto ficarão envolvidos nas políticas de pessoas e facções em conflito? Com qual frequência você espera que os heróis façam testes usando Perícias do grupo de Perícias de Intriga?

Esses são os tipos primários de cenas de várias campanhas, mas você pode adicionar categorias próprias. Por exemplo, se você quiser uma campanha repleta de quebra-cabeças diabólicos e armadilhas, você pode ter uma categoria de "Quebra-cabeças" no documento da sua proposta de campanha.

#### Frequência da Categoria

Dê um indicador a cada categoria para mostrar aos jogadores o quão frequente você espera que tenham cenas daquela categoria durante o jogo.

**Alta**: Se uma categoria tem frequência alta, você espera múltiplas cenas envolvendo este tipo de jogo durante cada sessão

**Média**: Se uma categoria tem frequência média, você espera pelo menos uma cena envolvendo este tipo de jogo durante cada sessão

**Baixa**: Se uma categoria tem frequência baixa, você espera uma cena envolvendo este tipo de jogo menos de uma vez por sessão

Frequências de categorias não são regras rígidas. Elas estão aí para dar aos jogadores uma ideia de que tipo de cenas você quer dirigir para eles. Pode haver uma ou duas sessões onde você pule uma categoria que marcou como alta ou média porque os heróis fizeram algo inesperado ou porque vocês estão se divertindo com a história indo por outro caminho.

#### Análise: Proteções do Último Imperador

A proposta de campanha "Proteções do Último Imperador" tem a seguinte análise de jogo

**Combate**: Média. Os heróis podem lutar com as forças de Ajax, guardiões das proteções e outras facções que procuram pelos tesouros do último imperador

**Exploração**: Alta. Os heróis devem viajar pelos locais mais remotos de Vasloria para encontrar as proteções

**Interpessoal**: Baixa. Heróis provavelmente irão interagir com outros personagens para encontrar as proteções, mas não haverá conversas ou negociações frequentes com eles

**Intriga**: Média. Heróis irão disputar regularmente com todos que querem os tesouros escondidos pelas proteções, usando sabotagem e contra-inteligência

### Adesão dos Jogadores

Depois da análise de jogo, diga aos jogadores o que é esperado deles para que o grupo tenha a maior diversão possível com o jogo. Deixe que saibam coisas como a frequência que você espera que viagem de um lugar ao outro, os tipos de recompensas ou honrarias que eles podem receber e as aventuras nas quais irão embarcar.

Você pode querer ser direto sobre que tipo de adesão você precisa dos jogadores. Então é uma boa ideia deixar que os jogadores saibam "Ei, para tirar o máximo desse jogo, você precisa gostar de explorar ruínas antigas". Ou diga "Esse jogo tem alguns temas de terror. Se você não quiser jogar heróis com medos que precisam enfrentar, nós deveríamos jogar outra coisa."

#### Adesão: Proteções do Último Imperador

Visitar vários locais e culturas diferentes tem que soar legal. Vocês não vão começar em uma cidade e eventualmente se tornar os heróis do baronato, mas vocês serão heróis lendários em vários reinos. Vocês estarão constantemente deixando pessoas que conheceram para trás, mas eventualmente terão uma base para onde podem retornar depois de cada missão. Vocês terão aliados e inimigos pelo mundo inteiro!

A adesão informa aos jogadores que seus heróis estarão viajando pelo mundo inteiro e que pode levar um tempo até terem um lar. Se um jogador está procurando uma experiência diferente, como um jogo que ocorre inteiramente na cidade de Capital, ele sabe agora que esse jogo não é para ele!

### Restrições de Opções dos Jogadores

Algumas campanhas incluem restrições nas opções de personagem que jogadores podem escolher. Por exemplo, um Diretor pode estar interessado em dirigir um jogo onde os heróis são todos Memoneks e Invasores do Futuro que vieram a Vasloria procurando por uma incursão secreta de Falantes Sem Voz. Neste caso, o Diretor pode restringir todas as outras Linhagens (veja o Capítulo 3). Uma campanha sobre cidadãos formando uma rebelião para derrubar um líder tirano pode restringir opções de Carreira (veja o Capítulo 4) para que ninguém seja Aristocrata ou Político.

Coloque quaisquer restrições da sua campanha na sua proposta!

### Apresentando Múltiplas Propostas

Se você tem múltiplas ideias de campanhas que quer dirigir, faça uma proposta para cada uma e pergunte aos jogadores qual parece mais interessante. É uma boa ideia que os jogadores ordenem cada proposta de acordo com suas preferências para que você saiba qual amaram, quais eles podem jogar e quais não têm nenhum interesse. Assim, se a maioria das pessoas amar duas propostas, mas uma delas faz um jogador dizer "De jeito nenhum!", você já sabe qual escolher.

### Discutindo a Proposta

Depois de dar a proposta aos jogadores, peça opiniões honestas. Se alguém não gosta de uma parte da proposta, não fique na defensiva. Escute seus jogadores. Você pode conseguir acomodá-los. Você pode estar disposto a ajustar sua análise de jogo ou adesão para jogar algo com seus amigos. Você pode estar disposto a tirar uma de suas restrições para um único jogador adicionar drama à campanha. Por exemplo, um aristocrata que se junta a um grupo de fazendeiros em uma rebelião é um ponto interessante da trama!

Também não há nenhum problema se, depois de ouvir seus jogadores em potencial, você não estiver interessado em dirigir o tipo de jogo que querem jogar. Isso acontece e é por isso que recomendamos fazer uma proposta de campanha. Não há mal nenhum em ter interesses diferentes, mas há em forçar as pessoas a jogarem algo que não será divertido para todos. Se você não conseguir concordar com um jogador, está tudo bem em concordar que ele ou você deve buscar um grupo diferente.

### Propondo uma Campanha Publicada

Escrever o seu próprio cenário de campanha e aventuras leva tempo! Talvez você queira poupar um pouco desse trabalho e dirigir aventuras em um cenário MCDM oficial, como Vasloria, com nossas aventuras publicadas que ocorrem nesse cenário. Nós também permitimos que editoras terceirizadas façam seus próprios cenários e aventuras para _Draw Steel_, então você pode querer usar um desses.

Se quiser dirigir uma campanha que use material publicado, dê uma lida, pense se há algo que você gostaria de mudar e então faça a proposta aos seus jogadores como faria caso tivesse criado a campanha por conta própria. Ao dirigir material publicado, você ainda é o Diretor. Você pode mudar qualquer coisa que não gostar ou achar que não combina com o seu grupo.

Se seus jogadores participarem em outros jogos de _Draw Steel_, é uma boa ideia perguntar a eles se conhecem aventuras publicadas quando fizer a proposta. Às vezes tudo bem que um jogador passe por uma aventura duas vezes, mas tipicamente há algum tipo de mistério ou reviravolta envolvido. É melhor dirigir algo novo para seus jogadores, então é bom saber o que já jogaram antes de fazer sua proposta.

## Regras da Casa

Você sempre pode mudar as regras para funcionar com sua campanha e preferências! Talvez combine mais com o ritmo de sua campanha se um Descanso durar 8 horas ou talvez uma semana. Você pode preferir que críticos sejam super raros e só ocorram com um 20 Natural. Você pode permitir que heróis gastem Vales Heroicos para reduzir a quantidade de Malícia que você tem (veja _Draw Steel: Monstros_). Você pode decidir que todos os heróis têm um Bônus de +1 em qualquer Característica que quiserem no Nível 1.

As regras que você cria ou modifica para adequar ao seu grupo são chamadas regras da casa. Você pode ter quantas quiser, mas deveria discutir essas mudanças com seus jogadores antes de adicioná-las. Se você decidir que críticos só ocorrem com um 20 Natural, o pior momento para um jogador descobrir isso é logo depois de tirar um 19 Natural durante o Combate.

Fale com seus jogadores sobre as regras da casa que quer usar em sua campanha e discuta quaisquer ideias que eles tragam a você para regras da casa durante a primeira sessão.

## Construindo a Campanha

Depois que seus jogadores concordarem com a proposta, é hora de construir o cenário onde seu jogo acontece.

### Lendo um Cenário Publicado

Se sua campanha ocorre em um cenário publicado, leia o material necessário à campanha que você propôs. Você não deveria sentir que precisa ler o cenário inteiro se não for pertinente à sua campanha. Por exemplo, se você tem uma campanha que ocorre inteiramente na Baronia de Dalrath, você provavelmente não precisa ler sobre a cidade de Leitopreto, uma cidade várias milhas além das fronteiras de Dalrath.

Conforme ler, faça anotações sobre qualquer coisa interessante no cenário que você pode incorporar em sua campanha e qualquer coisa que queira mudar.

Sua prioridade principal deve ser a localização inicial da campanha. Em qual distrito de Capital os jogadores iniciam sua primeira aventura? Qual mundo da Timescape será o primeiro visitado pelos heróis? Qual povoado em Vasloria tem sua primeira aventura? Responda a essa pergunta e se familiarize com esse lugar primeiro. Você terá bastante tempo para ler mais conforme planejar seus jogos.

### Construindo o Seu Próprio Cenário

Se planejar construir seu próprio cenário de campanha, o trabalho de construção de mundo pode ser esmagador. Mas não se preocupe! Você não precisa ter construído tudo antes da campanha começar. Seu mundo tem muito mais chance de ter camadas, ser interessante e autêntico se você começar pequeno e construir o cenário, povos e organizações conforme o necessário.

#### Comece Pequeno

Se você está planejando fazer seu próprio cenário de campanha, comece pequeno. Em vez de detalhar cada povoado em cada continente em cada planeta do universo, faça uma vila inicial ou distrito de uma cidade e os arredores de onde a primeira aventura acontece. Use os seguintes passos como um guia:

**Locais:** Faça uma lista de quaisquer locais importantes no ponto inicial da campanha, como uma estalagem ou casa onde os heróis ficam, comerciantes que podem querer visitar e o quartel-general de organizações que podem ser importantes para eles.

**NPCs:** Escreva o nome, Linhagem, idade, gênero e uma breve descrição da personalidade de cada NPC que pode interagir com os personagens nos locais que você criou.

**Locais de Aventura:** Repita os passos acima para quaisquer locais de aventura que os heróis podem visitar durante sua primeira aventura. Adicione detalhes aos locais, assim como a quaisquer NPCs e vilões importantes com os quais os heróis podem interagir.

**Organizações:** Você também pode detalhar as leis e funções de organizações com as quais os heróis podem interagir durante sua primeira aventura. Quais governos, igrejas e guildas podem ser encontradas? Como essas organizações podem interagir com os personagens? Você não precisa escrever cada artigo do código pirata, mas seria bom saber como os piratas reagem a aventureiros pedindo passagem em seu navio.

**Mapa:** Faça um mapa da área inicial. Ele não precisa ser bom! Só alguns pontos claramente nomeados e rabiscos detalhando os bairros de cidades ou localização de florestas, desertos, montanhas, corpos de água e outras formas de relevo já deve bastar.

Cada vez que precisar de um local ou local de aventura novo para uma aventura futura, crie os detalhes de forma semelhante e adicione-o ao seu mapa!

#### Mantenha as Coisas Vagas

Pode haver outros detalhes da sua campanha que você quer estabelecer antes de sua primeira aventura. Por exemplo, você pode querer saber onde fica o povoado mais próximo à vila inicial dos heróis ou o nome do monarca que governa o país dessa vila. Vá em frente e rascunhe os nomes de quaisquer locais que você sabe que serão uma parte importante da campanha, assim como uma frase para detalhes. Você poderá adicionar mais detalhes a esses elementos conforme for necessário nos seus preparativos para a campanha.

A razão principal para não se preparar demais para o futuro é que você não sabe como as escolhas dos jogadores e ações dos personagens podem mudar o mundo. Essas ações devem importar e ter consequências. É isso que torna o jogo divertido e autêntico. Quando o que acontece em uma sessão surpreender o Diretor, deve ser um momento de prazer - não um momento de estresse porque você acabou de perder vários preparativos.

Preparar demais significa que você acabará tendo mais trabalho que será descartado. Faça o mínimo que precisar para ficar confortável dirigindo o jogo e não mais.

### Estilos de Campanha

Você pode dirigir vários tipos de campanha em _Draw Steel_, com alguns dos tipos mais comuns discutidos a seguir. Qualquer um dos conceitos a seguir pode ser modificado conforme você julgar melhor para sua campanha.

#### Arco Longo

O arco longo é um modelo de campanha onde um vilão ou organização está por trás de quase toda ameaça que os heróis enfrentam. Se cada aventura fizer os heróis lutarem contra as forças de Ajax ou do vampiro Conde Rhodar Von Glauer antes de eventualmente enfrentar esse vilão principal em sua aventura final, então você tem uma campanha de arco longo. Arcos longos permitem que os heróis conheçam e até encontrem o vilão várias vezes antes do confronto final, permitindo a criação de drama pessoal com o antagonista principal e seus lacaios.

Se você planeja dirigir uma campanha de arco longo, você pode querer garantir que existem momentos onde a ameaça do vilão é mais quieta para que os heróis tenham chances de descansar e trabalhar em seus projetos de tempo livre.

#### Aventura da Semana

Uma campanha de aventura da semana permite que os heróis enfrentem uma ameaça totalmente nova cada vez que uma aventura começa. Durante sua primeira aventura, eles podem enfrentar cultistas trazendo uma horda de mortos-vivos ao mundo. Na próxima, eles lutam contra um bando de piratas determinados a tomar o controle de uma ilha pacífica. Depois disso é uma corrida para capturar um grupo de Invasores do Futuro antes que desapareçam na Timescape com suas vítimas sequestradas.

Campanhas de aventura da semana podem dar muito tempo livre aos heróis entre aventuras, pois as missões não são interligadas. Porém, essas campanhas geralmente não têm o drama pessoal de uma campanha com vilões e ameaças recorrentes.

#### Ameaça Iminente

Uma campanha de ameaça iminente é uma combinação das campanhas de arco longo e aventura da semana. Embora muitas das aventuras na campanha tenham ameaças individuais, algumas têm eventos planejados por um vilão recorrente que os heróis enfrentam no final da campanha. As forças do vilão podem fazer breves aparições para atacar os heróis em aventuras que não têm outras ligações com o vilão.

Uma campanha de ameaça iminente permite que os heróis criem drama pessoal com o vilão principal da campanha enquanto experimentam da variedade de uma campanha de aventura da semana.

#### Múltiplas Frentes

Em uma campanha de múltiplas frentes, vários vilões ameaçam o povo e ou locais que os personagens devem proteger, com os heróis forçados a priorizar as ameaças que enfrentam. Enquanto os heróis lidam com um de seus inimigos, os outros adversários avançam seus planos, crescendo em poder e recursos.

Campanhas de múltiplas frentes tornam o mundo autêntico e vivo, mas requerem mais preparo, pois você estará controlando múltiplos vilões e histórias ao mesmo tempo.

### Esboço dos Escalões

Como parte da sua criação de mundo, você pode fazer um esboço dos eventos que ocorrem em cada escalão da sua campanha. Quanto mais esses eventos se afastam do início da campanha, mais vagos podem ser os detalhes. As ações dos heróis devem importar e influenciar os eventos, então não planeje demais. Do contrário, você pode acabar descartando muito da sua preparação para fazer as decisões dos jogadores e personagens importarem.

Seu esboço deve incluir os planos dos vilões em sua campanha. Revise os Escalões de Jogo no Capítulo 1: O Básico para ter uma ideia do nível de ameaça e histórias que os heróis devem ter em cada estágio da campanha. Um esboço de escalões pode ser assim:

**1º Escalão**: Os heróis protegem a vila de Valcovas na Baronia de Bedegar contra as forças do Lorde Saxton, um usurpador e tirano leal a Ajax. Eventualmente, eles devem levar a luta até a fortaleza de Lorde Saxton, na Cidade de Bedegar.

**2º Escalão**: Depois de derrubar a fortaleza de Saxton, os heróis encontram uma carta de Ajax detalhando planos para reunir tesouros espalhados por Vasloria. Os heróis podem correr até esses locais para pegar os tesouros antes das forças de Ajax.

**3º Escalão**: Com alguns ou todos os tesouros, é questão de tempo até que o exército de Ajax ataque os heróis. Eles podem construir uma coalizão de aliados para enfrentar Ajax, mas esses aliados primeiro precisam de ajuda para se livrarem do governo do Santo de Ferro.

**4º Escalão**: Ajax traz a luta aos heróis. Se o Santo de Ferro perder, ele recua para seu santuário, onde os heróis podem ousar seguir.

### Complicações e Campanhas

Se os heróis em seu jogo escolheram Complicações durante a criação de personagem (veja Complicações), você deve também pensar em como a história de suas complicações pode afetar a campanha. Complicações não são apenas uma chance de adicionar um benefício e inconveniência ao herói. Elas são ganchos narrativos que você pode usar para trazer os jogadores à história da campanha.

Discuta os detalhes da Complicação de cada herói com o respectivo jogador. Complicações são intencionalmente vagas e qualquer dos seus detalhes narrativos podem ser modificados para que a história pessoal do herói se encaixe na campanha. Com os detalhes definidos, pergunte ao jogador como o herói se sente sobre a Complicação? Ele pensa que vale a pena ter a inconveniência? Ele está tentando ativamente se livrar da inconveniência, mas manter o benefício? Ou talvez ele queira se livrar da coisa toda e maldito seja o benefício!

#### Esboço de Escalões da Complicação

Uma vez que entenda os desejos de um herói para sua complicação, você pode criar um esboço de escalões da complicação para dar um pouco de desenvolvimento à história do herói durante a campanha. Veja o exemplo a seguir.

Matt, jogando como Linn, uma Talento, tem a Complicação "Hospedeiro Elemental". Depois de discutir os detalhes com o Diretor, Matt decide que anos atrás, Linn se jogou na frente de um feitiço feito por Sorin, o Marrom, um Elementalista de Terra maligno. Sorin queria sequestrar o Talento mentor de Linn, um Anão que era a cobaia perfeita para o próximo experimento letal de Sorin. Ao fazer isso, Linn salvou seu mentor e absorveu uma Força da Terra raivosa chamada Bruulv. Sorin escapou e deseja o retorno do seu elemental de estimação. Enquanto isso, Linn está mais resistente graças ao elemental, mas quando está morrendo, Bruulv toma o controle do seu corpo e libera uma fúria violenta.

Matt informa ao Diretor que Linn gosta da proteção adicional dada por Bruulv, pois isso a torna uma heroína mais resistente, e ela gostaria de uma forma de manter o benefício sem ter a inconveniência. O Diretor pensa em um esboço de escalões para Linn que enriquecerá a história da Talento e terá ligações com a história da campanha (que é a campanha de exemplo em Esboço dos Escalões).

**1º Escalão**: Depois que os heróis começam a provocar as forças de Lorde Saxton, Sorin oferece seus serviços ao tirano por uma chance de enfrentar Linn. Durante o ataque dos heróis à fortaleza, Sorin ataca.

**2º Escalão**: Assumindo que Sorin foi derrotada, Bruulv se torna ainda mais agressivo, tentando tirar o controle de Linn quando ela estiver Ofegante, além de quando estiver Morrendo. Linn encontra uma Coroa dos Elementos, um tesouro mágico especial que permite que ela force Bruulv a um estado de "assume controle apenas quando Morrendo". A coroa tem outros poderes elementais também - e é um dos objetos cobiçados por Ajax.

**3º Escalão**: Enquanto Linn e os outros heróis constroem uma coalizão, um Alto Elfo idoso chamado Folhas do Vento de Outono oferece melhorar a coroa, permitindo que a Talento fale diretamente com Bruulv. A pegadinha é que Folhas precisa de uma opala de fogo mágica do covil de um Gigante de Fogo para melhorar a coroa.

**4º Escalão**: Com a coroa melhorada, Linn consegue falar diretamente com Bruulv. Ao aprender a história do elemental através de uma negociação, ela percebe que Bruulv deseja principalmente voltar à Cidade de Bronze para vez novamente os poderes elementais brutos em união. Se Linn for até a cidade, literalmente a mundos de distância, ela ganha a confiança de Bruulv e o Elemental para de tomar o controle do seu corpo.

Em cada escalão, o Diretor deve revisar esse esboço, pois as ações dos jogadores podem mudar seus planos. Por exemplo, se Sorin fugir depois da batalha com Saxton no 1º Escalão, a Elementalista provavelmente retorna e tenta libertar Bruulv novamente!

## Criando Aventuras

Muitos Diretores preferem fazer suas próprias aventuras em vez de usar material publicado. Criar suas próprias aventuras permite ajustar a história para encaixar perfeitamente com as motivações dos heróis e assim maximizar a diversão dos jogadores.

Toda boa aventura inclui vilões, uma tarefa a cumprir e NPCs, bem como locais e locais de aventura interessantes.

> **Ambição dos Jogadores Escreve Aventuras**
>
> Jogadores têm sua ambição motivada por complicações do personagem, histórias pessoais e desejo por títulos, tesouros sobrenaturais e outras recompensas. Satisfaça esses desejos! Se um herói quer partir em uma jornada para ganhar uma Lâmina da Quintessência, deixe-o saber onde ele pode encontrar uma (depois que ele tiver feito a pesquisa adequada ou outras missões, é claro). Você pode planejar uma aventura, mesmo que seja curta, ao redor da obtenção da arma!

### Vilão

Toda boa aventura tem um vilão por trás dos problemas que os heróis tentam resolver. Este é um jogo sobre lutar contra monstros, afinal, então dê algo para lutar contra os heróis!

#### Pecados do Vilão

Você provavelmente conhece o ditado "Ações falam mais alto do que palavras." Isso se aplica a heróis e vilões de igual maneira. O que primariamente torna um vilão uma força do mal que os heróis - e jogadores - irão tentar parar a todo custo? As ações do vilão.

A melhor forma de deixar seus jogadores saberem que o seu vilão precisa ser derrotado é fazer o vilão realizar ações inquestionavelmente malignas! Antes dos heróis sequer encontrarem o vilão, eles devem encontrar corpos deixados para trás, testemunhar as vilas incendiadas ou escutar os testemunhos aterrorizantes daqueles sortudos o bastantes para sobreviverem à ira do vilão. Os resultados das ações do vilão deixam que os jogadores entendam as profundezas do mal que enfrentam. Vilões não hesitam em tomar ou arruinar as vidas de outros para terem o que querem. A maioria deles não se importa com dano colateral.

As duas coisas mais importantes que tornam o vilão da sua aventura digno do tempo dos heróis é o que ele já fez - e o que ele está planejando fazer. O que ele já fez mostra que ele não é apenas mau, mas também capaz. O que ele planeja fazer é pior do que o que já fez e, puxa vida, alguém precisa impedir isso.

Dê ao seu vilão uma história de crueldade que os heróis podem descobrir. Ela pode ser uma história curta. Talvez ele acabou de realizar o primeiro em uma série de assassinatos horas antes do heróis chegarem à vila. Ou a história pode cobrir anos como general, tirano ou entidade de destruição deixando para trás mundos inteiros arruinados. Deixe os pecados do vilão serem o que atrai os heróis à aventura - e lembre que não há motivação mais forte do que os jogadores decidindo que precisam parar o vilão antes que alguém o peça a eles. Um objetivo próprio funciona melhor do que ter um NPC implorar ou pagar aos heróis para que o trabalho seja feito. Ainda assim, o que começa como um trabalho frequentemente se torna uma missão pessoal, então não tenha receio de começar assim se esta parecer a melhor ideia.

Uma vez que o vilão descubra que os heróis estão interferindo em seus planos, eles não sentam e esperam que a luta chegue até eles. Não! Grandes vilões são proativos, enviando lacaios para lutar contra os heróis, incriminando-os, capturando seus entes queridos ou incendiando suas cidades natais.

#### Objetivos do Vilão

Muitos vilões não se veem como malignos. Na verdade, muitos heróis e vilões têm motivações similares - ambição, vingança e até proteger os outros ou salvar o mundo. A diferença é que vilões acreditam que seus objetivos pessoais são mais importantes do que qualquer outra coisa, estando dispostos a sacrificar o bem-estar e vidas de outros para conseguirem o que querem.

Qualquer das seguintes opções é um ótimo objetivo rápido de vilão ou pode servir como inspiração para os objetivos que você pensar:

- O vilão tem uma vingança pessoal contra outra pessoa ou grupo de pessoas que o prejudicaram.
- O vilão acredita que governar é seu direito de nascença ou porque ele se acredita o mais qualificado.
- O vilão quer viver para sempre para proteger seu povo, posses, terras ou legado.
- O vilão sabe de uma grande ameaça e precisa de poder supremo para derrotá-la.

Em vez de conquistar seus objetivos com diplomacia e heroísmo, esses vilões tomam o que precisam para alcançar seus objetivos e destroem qualquer um e qualquer coisa que fique no caminho.

Claro, existem alguns vilões que querem causar violência e destruição por si só! Esses vilões podem ser divertidos de se ter em uma aventura de tempos em tempos, mas muitos são o tipo de personagem que são tipicamente manipulados por vilões com motivações ainda maiores. Assim sendo, não devem ser o foco de toda aventura em toda campanha.

> **Roubar é Encorajado**
>
> Quando estiver pensando em ideias para campanhas, aventuras e cenas, você deve se sentir livre para roubar histórias, cenas de ação, personagens e tudo mais o que quiser de seus filmes, séries de televisão, livros, quadrinhos e podcasts favoritos. Você pode modificar alguns detalhes estéticos para tornar as coisas suas. Você está pegando um personagem humano masculino do seu livro favorito para ser um NPC? Torne o NPC uma mulher Anã com um novo nome e ninguém perceberá. Teve uma ideia para um encontro baseado em uma cena de batalha do seu filme favorito de ficção científica? Troque os alienígenas invasores por gnolls! Deixe suas histórias favoritas lhe inspirarem, especialmente quando estiver procurando novas ideias.

### Objetivo da Aventura

Toda aventura deve dar aos heróis um objetivo claro a alcançar. Enquanto a maioria dos objetivos pode se resumir a "impedir o vilão de fazer algo ruim", é melhor se os heróis tiverem uma ideia específica de como parar ou minimizar as consequências do plano do vilão. Idealmente, eles serão capazes de alcançar esse objetivo de várias maneiras.

O objetivo supremo da aventura dos heróis deve ser um que impeça ou previna o cumprimento total do objetivo do vilão. Se os heróis vivem sob o governo opressivo de um tirano que usurpou um lorde e aprisiona qualquer um que questionar sua autoridade, eles podem lutar para ajudar o herdeiro de direito a recuperar sua posição. Eles podem participar de intrigas políticas para se aproximar do tirano antes de derrubá-lo. Eles podem liderar o povo em uma rebelião que instala uma nova forma de governo. "Depor o tirano e instalar uma liderança melhor" é o objetivo supremo da aventura dos heróis, embora tenham várias formas de alcançar esse objetivo.

O objetivo de uma aventura nem sempre resulta em uma falha total para o vilão. Às vezes os heróis precisam simplesmente evitar o máximo de destruição possível enquanto sobrevivem para lutar mais um dia. Por exemplo, se Ajax, o Invencível, ataca a cidade portuária de Leitopreto para forçar seus líderes a obedecerem, um grupo de heróis de 1º Nível não tem os recursos e poder para resistirem ao ataque e pará-lo. Assim sendo, o objetivo da aventura pode ser fugir da cidade levando o máximo de pessoas inocentes para um local seguro - e ficar vivo para enfrentar o vilão depois. Eles ainda são heróis por salvarem as pessoas, mesmo que não possam parar os planos do vilão.

### Descobrindo o Objetivo

O objetivo de uma aventura nem sempre é claro para os jogadores no começo, mas os heróis devem sempre ter uma boa idea de como seguir a história. Jogo e diversão podem parar totalmente se os jogadores não tiverem ideia do que seus personagens podem fazer para avançarem em seus objetivos.

Cada aventura deve ter um evento desencadeador que dá o objetivo da aventura aos heróis ou apresenta o caminho para descobrir o objetivo da aventura. Se os heróis começam uma aventura descobrindo o corpo recém-assassinado de um nobre nas ruas de Capital, eles provavelmente irão procurar por pistas que podem levar a encontrar o assassino - um objetivo sólido e direto para uma aventura. Ou pode ser que o assassinato os leve a descobrir uma grande conspiração onde uma das Grandes Casas de Capital está planejando um golpe violento e coordenado ao governo da cidade. Os heróis devem impedir esses planos - um objetivo de aventura que pode levar várias cenas para descobrir totalmente. Mas cada uma dessas cenas deve levar à próxima sem que os jogadores pensem "O que fazemos agora?"

> **Complicações e Aventuras**
>
> Se os heróis na sua campanha têm complicações (veja Complicações e Campanhas), é uma boa ideia ter pelo menos uma complicação dando problema para um herói durante uma aventura ou sendo parte da história da aventura. Rotacione o herói cuja complicação ganha o holofote a cada vez, para que todos tenham uma chance de estar no centro da história.

### Criando NPCs

Os heróis e monstros terríveis que eles derrotam não devem ser os únicos nas aventuras. Alguns personagens amigáveis (ou pelo menos não-hostis) podem fornecer informações, equipamento e - principalmente - uma boa razão para arriscarem suas vidas. Se todos que encontrarem forem monstros, apáticos ou canalhas egoístas, os jogadores não ficarão muito motivados em serem os heróis dessas pessoas.

Os NPCs que os heróis encontram durante suas aventuras devem ser pessoas complexas. Eles têm motivações pessoais para ajudar os heróis, personalidade, peculiaridades e falhas de caráter. Uma aventura tipicamente contém pelo menos três ou quatro NPCs que você detalhará mais, dependendo de quantas cenas você planejar e quantos NPCs cada cena precisar.

Ao criar um NPC, escreva rapidamente as seguintes informações sobre ele:

#### Detalhes Pessoais

Qual o nome desse NPC? O que ele faz para viver?

#### Detalhes

O que é notável sobre a aparência do NPC? Ele tem alguma característica marcante, como uma faixa de cabelo grisalho ou colorido no cabelo, uma barba grande, uma tatuagem do crânio de uma cobra ou cicatriz sobre um olho? Ele tem algum cheiro específico (bom ou mau)?

#### Voz

Quando o NPC fala, como é a sua voz? Você não precisa imitar uma voz toda vez que falar como esse NPC, ,as falar aos jogadores "Esse elfo fala como um pirata" ou "Esse anão tem uma voz aguda com falsete" ajuda a lembrar e diferenciar esse NPC de outros.

#### Comportamento

Quais comportamentos notáveis esse NPC tem? Talvez ele mantenha contato visual constante ou raramente tira os olhos dos próprios pés. Ele pode cutucar o nariz, repetir um bordão, falar consigo mesmo, roer as unhas, sussurrar sempre que falar algo profundo (ou profano!) ou um pigarro constante. Dar a um NPC só uma dessas distinções ajuda a fixá-lo nas mentes dos jogadores e torná-lo mais autêntico.

#### Falha

Quais falhas de caráter esse NPC tem? Ele pode ser egoísta quando se trata de dinheiro, ignorar higiene pessoal, mentir para cobrir inseguranças ou agir covardemente em frente a qualquer perigo. Uma única falha é suficiente. Falhas demais e o NPC irá de autêntico a autenticamente desagradável bem rápido.

#### Ajudando os Heróis

Por que esse NPC quer ajudar os heróis durante essa aventura? Ele não precisa estar totalmente de acordo com ajudar os heróis a princípio. Pode ser necessário algum convencimento na forma de um Teste, Negociação ou outra tarefa que os heróis precisem cumprir para ter a ajuda desse personagem. Mas provavelmente já existe pelo menos um núcleo de motivação no NPC - ou então ele não tem motivo pra ajudar. Pode ser que ele não queira o sucesso do vilão, pode ver uma oportunidade lucrativa em ajudar os heróis ou pense que deve um favor aos heróis por uma aventura anterior.

#### Negando Ajuda

O que impede esse NPC de ajudar os heróis? É possível que a resposta seja "nada", mas a maioria das pessoas terá algo ou alguém que não estão dispostos a arriscar, mesmo que o destino do mundo esteja em risco. O que o vilão poderia ameaçar que faz o NPC pensar duas vezes antes de ajudar os heróis? Pode ser um ente querido, um local importante ou um tesouro valioso.

### Locais Interessantes

Uma boa aventura tem locais interessantes que os heróis visitam. Esses locais não precisam ser fantásticos para serem interessantes (embora não seja ruim colocar um ou dois lugares fantásticos em uma aventura). Uma pequena vila de fazendas pode ser um local interessante se há eventos envolventes e intriga acontecendo. Até pequenos dramas, como quem envenenou as plantações da fazendeira Yelena ou qual mulher o pastor Jon irá pedir em casamento são os tipos de eventos que tornam um local mais envolvente.

Faça uma lista dos diferentes locais que os heróis podem visitar durante a aventura, incluindo locais genéricos e locais de aventura específicos.

#### Locais Genéricos

Um local genérico é uma vila ou região selvagem definida que os heróis podem visitar durante a aventura.

Se a aventura é em uma metrópole gigante como Capital, então diferentes distritos de cidade e grandes marcos, como catacumbas e parques, contam como locais genéricos. Se a aventura ocorre em uma área regional maior do que uma cidade, mas não maior do que um planeta, então povoados inteiros e biomas como desertos e florestas são locais genéricos. Se a aventura ocorre pela Timescape (ou um meio similar com diversos mundos), então um local genérico pode ser um mundo inteiro ou quaisquer povoados específicos ou biomas que os heróis visitem naquele mundo.

Você não precisa definir tudo sobre esses locais porque você terá mais detalhes sobre os locais específicos que os heróis poderão visitar em qualquer local mais tarde. Você pode usar as perguntas a seguir sobre cada local genérico como um ponto de partida para o que você irá cobrir (e você pode já ter feito partes disso ao criar uma área inicial durante o preparo da campanha):

**Clima**: Qual o clima desse local? É perigoso e pacífico? Sombrio e pesado? Tenso e perigoso? Os cabelos de sua nuca se arrepiam quando você está aqui ou é o tipo de lugar onde se pode relaxar?

**Sentidos:** Quais são as primeiras coisas que você percebe sobre esse lugar com seus sentidos? O que você vê, escuta ou cheira? Qual o gosto do ar? Qual a sensação dele na sua pele? O que se destaca e é único entre as coisas que você percebe?

**Criaturas:** Quais criaturas não-hostis podem ser encontradas aqui? Podem ser transeuntes, comerciantes de rua, animais ou coisas desconhecidas se movendo nas sombras.

Ter esses detalhes ajudará a estabelecer cenas conforme os heróis viajam por esses locais genéricos para chegarem a um ou outro local específico.

#### Locais Específicos

Um local específico é um local onde uma cena da aventura ocorre. Pode ser uma construção, complexo de prédios, rua ou quarteirão de cidade, uma clareira de floresta, um oásis, uma ponte e afins. Os encontros de combate e outras cenas na aventura ocorrem nesses locais específicos.

Ao criar um local específico, faça as seguintes perguntas além das perguntas que faria sobre um local genérico:

- Por que os heróis viriam aqui durante a aventura?
- Que tipos de cenas podem ocorrer nesse local?
- Quais NPCs com os quais os heróis podem interagir podem ser encontrados nesse local?
- Quais informações, itens ou confrontos os heróis podem descobrir aqui que ajudarão a avançar na aventura?

### Planeje Cenas

Uma vez que tenha seu vilão, objetivo da aventura, NPCs e locais genéricos e específicos, é hora de começar a amarrá-los para criar cenas. Sua aventura terá encontros de combate, Testes de Montagem, Negociações, Descansos e cenas de exploração e interação social. A seção "Criando Cenas" a seguir tem mais informações sobre detalhar as cenas de suas aventuras, mas planejar essas cenas é o primeiro passo.

Quando estiver pensando em cenas, escreva quais locais e NPCs estão envolvidos nessas cenas, para então organizá-las em uma ordem que faça sentido para a história. Pode ser que depois do seu evento desencadeador, algumas cenas possam ocorrer em qualquer ordem. Por exemplo, se o objetivo da aventura é recuperar três peças de um antigo cajado antes do vilão, os heróis podem conseguir explorar os três locais onde o cajado está escondido em qualquer ordem que preferirem. Sua escolha pode até ter consequências. Pode ser que o primeiro local que escolham não tem nenhum dos lacaios do vilão ainda, o segundo tem um conflito com esses lacaios e o terceiro já foi saqueado pelo vilão quando chegam lá! Outras cenas podem precisar ocorrer mais linearmente. Uma investigação tipicamente inclui um rastro de pistas que leva heróis de uma cena até a próxima, mas os jogadores podem lhe surpreender.

Não se case com a ordem planejada de cenas. Se os heróis tiverem azar com os dados em alguns encontros de combate, eles podem parar para descansar e restaurar seu Vigor e Recuperações antes do que você imaginava. Se os heróis estão desvendando um mistério, eles podem fazer deduções inesperadas que permitem pular uma de suas cenas ou locais! Isto é parte da diversão do jogo. Os dados e jogadores vão lhe surpreender.

Abrace essa imprevisibilidade mantendo uma mente aberta conforme planeja suas cenas e permita-se ser flexível. É provável que um encontro de combate que os jogadores pularam durante uma sessão possa ser ajustado e reaproveitado em outra sessão, então não se preocupe. O jogo é mais recompensador para você e para os outros jogadores se você deixar que as escolhas e ações dos heróis signifiquem algo e afetem o jogo.

Uma vez que todas as suas cenas estejam planejadas, é hora de juntá-las em um esboço de aventura.

### Esboço da Aventura

Seu esboço da aventura é um documento que você pode usar para dirigir suas sessões de jogo. Ele contém informações sobre o vilão, o objetivo da aventura, NPCs, locais e cenas. Você pode formatar esse esboço como quiser, como frases escritas por completo, listas, uma rede de eventos ou qualquer outra coisa que faça sentido para você.

O esboço de aventura padrão contém informações gerais sobre o vilão, objetivo e NPCs. Depois disso há uma lista de locais e locais de aventura, com locais específicos descrevendo os detalhes de cada cena que ocorre ali. O esboço então encerra com uma seção de conclusão discutindo o impacto das ações dos heróis na campanha geral e no mundo do jogo.

### Criando Cenas

Ao preparar cenas para uma ventura, tenha em mente que **você não pode e não deve tentar controlar como os heróis interagem com os desafios de uma cena**. Como Diretor, muito da diversão do jogo vem de ver os jogadores resolvendo os desafios propostos de forma criativa, usando os recursos e habilidades dos heróis. Você deve planejar obstáculos para os personagens sabendo que podem pensar em soluções que você não pensou. Deixe que testem essas soluções e veja para onde a história vai!

É melhor preparar cenas como: "Aqui está a situação quando os heróis chegam". O mundo do jogo é um cenário autêntico. Quer os heróis apareçam, quer não o façam, bandidos ainda saqueariam, políticos ainda trairiam e tempestades de areia ainda soprariam pelo deserto. Cada cena deve começar com a pergunta: "O que está acontecendo quando os heróis chegam?"

Depois de preparar sua cena, faça uma lista dos elementos narrativos que os heróis podem descobrir ou conquistar naquela cena que irão avançar a história da aventura. Ao dirigir o jogo, você permitirá que os jogadores abordem a conquista dessas coisas da maneira que preferirem. Entretanto, você pode ter algumas ideias de como cumpririam esses objetivos, como quais testes podem fazer para achar pistas ao redor do cadáver que levam a um assassino ou uma possível Negociação para obterem passagem segura através do mar. Anote essas possíveis soluções e quaisquer regras que precisa preparar o uso durante o preparo de suas cenas.

Nem tudo que os heróis fazem é digno de uma cena e você não precisa realizar aventuras em tempo real. Se eles quiserem andar de uma fazenda a um castelo, você não precisa interpretar a caminhada a menos que seja divertido para você e seus jogadores ou algo significativo aconteça ao longo do caminho (como um ataque de bandidos ou descoberta de um corpo). Você não precisa narrar cada ida ao mercado ou viagem de barco se essas cenas seriam entediantes. É um jogo! Dirija as cenas que são divertidas para você e que avancem a história, assim seus jogos serão melhores.

### Fichas do Diretor

Fichas do Diretor são um recurso que você pode usar para preparar e monitorar o progresso de personagens durante encontros de combate, Negociações e Testes de Montagem. Essas fichas permitem que você monitore os objetivos e números relevantes ao desafio, como o Vigor de inimigos, Interesse e Paciência de NPCs, além do número de sucessos e fracassos em um Teste de Montagem. Cada ficha tem uma segunda página opcional que permite monitorar detalhes narrativos, potenciais recompensas e NPCs secundários na cena. Você pode obter essas fichas em *https://mcdm.gg/DS-Resources*.

### Criando e Dirigindo Combate

Há muito o que dizer sobre criar e preparar ótimos encontros de combate para _Draw Steel_. Tanto que tivemos que colocar todas as sugestões em outro livro - o que tem todos os monstros e outras coisas que você precisa para construir encontros de combate. Dê uma olhada em _Draw Steel: Monstros_.

Uma dica que notaremos aqui (e que também está no outro livro porque é válido repetir) é que encontros de combate devem ter peso narrativo. _Draw Steel_ não é um jogo de atrito, onde alguns combates triviais podem enfraquecer os heróis para gastarem recursos e tornar o conflito épico, final e importante contra o vilão um esforço ainda maior. Um encontro rápido de combate com dois guardas em um portão provavelmente acaba em menos de uma rodada e não deve dar uma Vitória aos heróis. Essas podem ser cenas divertidas de interpretar, mas não farão uso total das capacidades dos heróis e devem ocorrer apenas ocasionalmente. A maioria das vezes quando combate ocorre, os riscos para os heróis e para a história devem ser altos!

### Criando e Dirigindo Exploração

Cenas de exploração são momentos dirigidos pela narrativa onde os heróis investigam seus arredores para avançar a história ou descobrir recompensas. Tudo desde vasculhar o local de um assassinato por pistas até desvendar ruínas antigas para um portal até Axiom, o Plano da Lei Suprema, é uma cena de exploração.

Ao dirigir cenas de exploração, seu trabalho é definir a cena, ouvir os jogadores descrevendo as ações de seus heróis e então responder com como essas ações afetam o ambiente.

#### Informações Necessárias e Desnecessárias

Ao preparar uma cena de exploração, você desejará escrever suas respostas às seguintes perguntas:

- Quais informações ou objetos os heróis precisam recuperar nessa cena que irão ajudar a avançar a história do jogo?
- Quais informações extras e outras recompensas eles podem obter nessa cena se explorarem totalmente e com sucesso?

As informações ou objetos que os heróis precisam da cena de exploração para avançar a história devem ter uma forma de serem encontrados sem um Teste. Só de entrar na cena do assassinato de um monarca, os heróis podem aprender que um rei foi assassinado com uma faca, porque seu corpo e arma ainda estão completamente visíveis. Eles devem também perceber que a faca tem o brasão de uma família nobre, dando um caminho óbvio para continuar a aventura. Outros detalhes na sala podem acelerar a investigação de quem matou o rei, mas eles encontram de graça o mínimo necessário para continuarem.

Tudo bem que um Teste seja a _melhor_ forma de conseguir as informações necessárias. Mas se os heróis falharem ou não fizerem o Teste, garanta que há outro caminho - provavelmente um mais difícil - para continuar a história. Ao vasculhar a torre de um necromante por um livro que ajudará a parar um ritual, os personagens podem perder todas as pistas que apontam para o livro. Mas eles podem depois encontrar os aprendizes do necromante, que sabem onde o livro está - e não estão dispostos a dar essa informação sem uma luta difícil.

Outras informações e recompensas que os heróis podem ganhar em uma cena de exploração podem estar escondidas atrás de Testes que podem ser falhados ou perdidos. Se os heróis não pensarem em olhar embaixo da mesa do rei morto, eles não encontram o cálice que rolou até ali. Se eles encontrarem o cálice, mas falharem em um Teste de Razão para examiná-lo, eles não aprendem que há resíduos de um veneno raro, potencialmente levando-os até um alquimista próximo que vende o veneno. Eles ainda conseguem resolver o mistério sem essa informação, mas levará mais tempo. Entretanto, quanto mais tempo levar, mais tempo o assassino tem para se preparar para sua chegada, então perder esses detalhes tem consequências!

Uma vez que tenha sua lista de informações e objetos que os heróis podem encontrar, faça uma lista de onde e como essas coisas podem ser encontradas. Algumas podem precisar de um Teste. Algumas podem precisar apenas que o jogador descreva uma certa ação do herói, como vasculhar uma estante ou mesa. Mas enquanto você anota o que é necessário para encontrar informações ou objetos, não tente cobrir todas as opções. Mesmo que o faça, os jogadores vão pensar em coisas com seus múltiplos cérebros que você jamais poderia pensar e você terá que julgar essas escolhas em cima da hora. Saber onde e como informações e objetos estão escondidos ou guardados dos heróis é mais importante do que saber como eles vão obter essas coisas. Se você consegue pensar em pelo menos uma maneira e estiver aberto a outras possibilidades, os heróis têm uma chance justa.

#### Definindo a Cena

Quando uma cena de exploração começa, descreva aos heróis o que eles percebem ao seu redor. Começar com o que os heróis enxergam é uma boa ideia, mas todos os personagens têm outros sentidos. Mencione o que podem cheirar, ouvir e sentir no ambiente se for aplicável ao que estão investigando. Esses pequenos detalhes podem ajudar os jogadores a imaginar melhor a cena e levá-los a momentos narrativos importantes ali. Antes de dirigir a cena, escreva esses detalhes para que você possa descrevê-los logo no começo em vez de tentar improvisar no momento.

Você não precisa listar cada detalhe em um ambiente. Isso leva a jogadores passando muito tempo interagindo com os elementos do ambiente que você só incluiu para caracterização e pode levar você a falar coisas como "Sim, eu sei que descrevi as tapeçarias por cinco minutos, mas realmente não tem nada nelas. Agora, a pilha de ossos no meio do chão, por outro lado..." Muitos jogadores também perderão o foco com muitos detalhes, mesmo que você dê uma narração digna de um Oscar. Em vez disso, limite-se às partes do ambiente que são dignas da atenção dos personagens.

Como um exemplo, se os heróis estão explorando um esconderijo abandonado de bandidos em uma caverna para acharem informações sobre para onde os bandidos foram, você pode descrever uma pilha de dejetos no canto da caverna, um chão molhado de lama e os restos fumegantes de um fogo apagado. Por que apontar essas coisas? Porque a pilha de dejetos tem um mapa rasgado para o novo esconderijo dos bandidos, o chão com lama significa que os bandidos deixaram alguns rastros que podem ser seguidos e os restos de fogo significam que pelo menos alguns deles saíram há pouco tempo, então podem ainda estar no caminho até o novo esconderijo. Você deu aos personagens e jogadores três elementos importantes para interagir, cada um dando informações que podem usar para avançar a história ou ter uma ideia do futuro próximo. Você não precisa descrever as estalactites no teto ou o som do vento assoviando na entrada da caverna ou a pilha de madeira perto da fogueira ou as lesmas rastejando nessa pilha. Embora um ou dois desses detalhes possam ser atmosféricos, detalhes demais irão distrair os jogadores e quebrar a imersão do jogo. Em vez disso, você pode preencher esses detalhes secundários conforme os jogadores fazem perguntas e exploram o ambiente.

#### Heróis Investigam

Depois de definir a cena de exploração, deixe que cada jogador faça perguntas sobre o ambiente e descreva como o herói interage com os arredores. Se um jogador fizer uma pergunta que seu herói não saberia a resposta, você pode encorajar explorar. Por exemplo, se um jogador cujo herói está na entrada da caverna perguntar "O que eu vejo na pilha de dejetos?", você pode responder "De onde você está, parece uma pilha de lixo com roupa e ossos, mas pode ter algo a mais se você vasculhar." Isso encoraja que os jogadores sejam mais ativos no processo de investigação.

Permita que a investigação dos heróis conduza a ação. Em uma cena de exploração, você deve assumir o papel de ambiente, reagindo às escolhas dos personagens e jogadores. Não diga aos jogadores o que seus heróis fazem. Em vez disso, descrevas as consequências de suas ações. Se personagens passarem um tempo para cuidadosamente procurarem armadilhas no esconderijo, eles devem ter uma chance de encontrar quaisquer armadilhas que você colocou ali. Mas se um herói corre para dentro da caverna e aciona uma armadilha escondida porque ele não teve cuidado em território hostil, isso é culpa dele! É uma lição importante que o o jogador deve lembrar para a próxima vez.

> **Os Jogadores Vão Surpreender-lhe**
>
> Até as aventuras mais preparadas raramente sobrevivem ao primeiro contato com os heróis. Suas notas de sessão esperam que os jogadores façam seus personagens entrarem no esconderijo dos bandidos por uma entrada secreta nos fundos, mas um jogador tem a brilhante ideia de entrar através de uma rachadura no teto. É perfeitamente aceitável fugir do roteiro e adaptar aos planos dos jogadores se isso for divertido para todos.
>
> Isso não quer dizer que tudo bem que os heróis ignorem o esconderijo dos bandidos totalmente e saiam a procura de cultistas em outro lugar. Mas enquanto os jogadores estiverem participando do espírito da aventura, adaptar-se ao inesperado é provavelmente a maior diversão que você terá em dirigir o jogo.

#### Quando Usar um Teste

Os heróis podem geralmente conseguir informações básicas só de interagirem com o ambiente. Se um jogador perguntar "Parece que o chão de lama prenderia nas botas de alguém?", ter uma confirmação não precisa de um Teste. Porém, seguir as pegadas que saem da caverna até o novo esconderijo dos bandidos precisa de um Teste, porque essa é uma tarefa mais difícil cuja falha significaria que os bandidos têm tempo para preparar uma emboscada para quando os heróis chegarem! Se um personagem quer investigar meticulosamente a pilha de dejetos e examinar cada resto de lixo, nenhum Teste é necessário para encontrar o mapa rasgado, a menos que esteja sob um limite de tempo para fazer isso. Entretanto, um personagem juntando todas as partes do mapa precisa de um Teste de Razão para juntar as peças, porque falhar nisso significa que os heróis obtém apenas informação incompleta ao continuar sua investigação.

Capítulo 9: Testes explica Testes em detalhes e fornece exemplos de dificuldades diferentes para Testes. Muitos outros jogos de fantasia reflexivamente pedem por um lançamento de dados a qualquer hora que um herói tenta fazer algo. Entretanto, _Draw Steel_ gira em torno da ideia de que o Diretor pede por Testes apenas quando o fracasso tornaria a história mais interessante para os heróis e não pararia o jogo totalmente. Você pode acabar pedindo por menos Testes do que está acostumado - e esta é a maneira como o jogo deve ser jogado!

Além disso, se um jogador tem uma ideia particularmente esperta e plausível para superar um desavio, você pode deixar ele ter um sucesso automático na tarefa, mesmo se a falha tornaria a história mais interessante. É importante recompensar ideias espertas de vez em quando para que jogadores sejam encorajados a pensar fora da caixa e criem momentos memoráveis!

Em contraste, às vezes um jogador irá propor algo que ele acha plausível ou inteligente, mas você não vê como isso pode funcionar. Tudo bem dizer ao jogador "Isso não vai funcionar." Você não tem obrigação de permitir que um jogador realize um Teste para algo que vai falhar automaticamente.

#### Dificuldade de Testes

Testes em _Draw Steel_ têm três níveis de resultados, com todos os jogadores sabendo esses resultados e os lances de dados que resultam neles. Fazer um Teste sempre significa algo porque todos os Testes possuem riscos! Antes de pedir um Teste, você precisa definir uma dificuldade de fácil, médio ou difícil para o Teste.

Um herói sempre terá sucesso em um **Teste Fácil**. É só uma questão de caso terá uma consequência ou recompensa juntamente com o sucesso. Por este motivo, você deve usar esses Testes raramente em suas aventuras.

Um herói com modificador de +1 ou mais no Teste provavelmente terá sucesso em um **Teste Médio**. Sucesso com uma consequência é comum para heróis se o bônus no Teste for menor do que +4, então terão sucesso com um custo. Provavelmente a maioria dos Testes será deste nível de dificuldade. Eles dão as heróis uma chance decente de sucesso sem serem uma certeza e as coisas podem ficar interessantes quando consequências ocorrem.

**Testes Difíceis** são exatamente o que parecem. Você só pode ter um sucesso com um resultado de 17 ou mais, o que significa que um herói só tem uma chance acima de 50% se tiver um bônus de pelo menos +6 no Teste. No 1º Nível, isso significa usar a maior Característica, uma Perícia e ter uma Vantagem. Falhar em Testes Difíceis geralmente significa consequências além do mero fracasso, então é bem arriscado! Você provavelmente verá que Testes Difíceis não são tão comuns quanto Médios, mas ocorrem mais do que Testes Fáceis.

#### Definindo a Dificuldade Durante o Jogo

Ao pedir um Teste, você pode informar a dificuldade do Teste ao jogador. Dizer "Faça um Teste Difícil de Razão" pode ser um momento dramático na mesa, com todos segurando a respiração para ver se o resultado é um sucesso, fracasso ou fracasso com consequências maiores.

Por outro lado, não compartilhar a dificuldade de cada Teste com os jogadores permite mexer um pouco na dificuldade se você quiser. Você pode pedir um Teste e achar que não é necessário quando o jogador lançar os dados. É fácil simplesmente dizer "Ei, perdão. Eu não devia ter pedido um Teste. Você só faz a coisa." Mas se quiser ser legal, lembre que todo nível de um Teste Fácil é um sucesso. É só uma questão de ter ou não uma consequência ou recompensa. Se um herói obtiver um 11 ou menos no Teste e você acha que ainda merecia ter sucesso, então a dificuldade era fácil.

#### Resultados de Testes

Depois que um herói faz um Teste, cabe a você narrar e decidir o resultado, mantendo em mente algumas orientações básicas.

Se um teste é uma **falha com consequência**, o herói não só falha - ele torna as coisas piores. Ele pode chamar a atenção de inimigos próximos, acionar um perigo ou armadilha, sofrer dano, causar dano a um aliado, ter uma Desvantagem em um Teste futuro, perder um objeto Mundano, deixar um NPC amigável irritado ou até lhe dar um pouco de Malícia para o futuro. A consequência é decisão sua!

Se o teste é uma **falha**, o herói não faz o que queria. Mas mesmo que não haja uma consequência formal, efeitos negativos ainda podem acompanhar Testes fracassados dependendo das circunstâncias. Se um herói tenta se mover silenciosamente perto de um grupo de guardas, uma falha no Teste pode atrair a atenção dos guardas, mas o personagem deve ter uma chance de reagir antes de acionarem o alarme. Mas se o personagem tivesse uma falha com consequência, ele seria visto imediatamente e os guardas correriam para atacar.

Se o teste é um **sucesso com consequências**, o herói tem sucesso, mas sofre um efeito negativo significativo. Ele pode se esgueirar pelos guardas, mas perde seu cinto no processo, forçando-o a decidir se volta para pegar o equipamento ou segue em frente.

Se um teste é um **sucesso**, o herói faz o que queria! Você pode até deixar que o jogador narre o resultado perguntando "Como você fez isso?"

Se um teste é um **sucesso com recompensa**, o herói faz o que queria - e mais além. A recompensa pode ser permitir que outro herói tenha um sucesso automático na sua vez de fazer o teste, uma Vantagem em um teste futuro, revelar um Tesouro escondido, inspirar um NPC próximo a ajudar ou ganhar um Vale Heroico para o grupo. A recompensa é decisão sua para criar ou escolher.

Alguns exemplos de consequências e recompensas para Testes estão detalhadas em Capítulo 9: Testes.

### Criando e Dirigindo Perigos

Perigos incluem armadilhas e perigos naturais como areia movediça e avalanches, mas também perigos sobrenaturais, como ruínas com radiação mágica ou nuvens de energia psiônica instável. Perigos podem aparecer em cenas de combate e exploração como perigos que um herói precisa lidar enquanto resolve outros problemas. Um perigo elaborado pode ser uma cena por si só também, seja resolvido em um Teste de Montagem, seja com rondas como se fosse um combate.

Um bom perigo representa uma ameaça real aos heróis e fica no caminho de algo que querem. Atravessar um lago de lava não é um problema se os heróis puderem simplesmente andar ao redor. Mas se o lago for grande demais para isso ou o Tesouro que o grupo procura estiver no fundo do lago, agora ele é algo que não pode ser ignorado facilmente.

Os perigos que você criará e usará em suas aventuras pode ser de três tipos:

**Ativado Perpétuo:** Um perigo ativado perpétuo pode ser ativado por um fio, um som alto, uma placa de pressão ou outro mecanismo que responda às ações dos heróis. O perigo então fica ativo até ser resolvido, como uma armadilha de lâmina pendular que é acionada por um fio e então fica balançando sobre uma ponte.

**Ativado Uso-único**: Um perigo ativado de uso-único é ativado e então cria um momento de perigo. Às vezes esse perigo acaba tão rápido quanto inicia, como uma armadilha que dispara um único dardo venenoso. Outras vezes, esse momento de perigo pode criar problemas duradouros que os heróis precisam resolver, como um desmoronamento de uma caverna que causa dano e deixa o grupo preso em uma mina abandonada.

**Obstrução:** Obstruções são perigos que os heróis precisam contornar, como piscinas de ácido, desfiladeiros e rios de lava. Como esses perigos tendem a ser estáticos, um herói só sofre dano deles como resultado de um Teste falho em uma tentativa de atravessar o perigo.

> **Terrenos como Perigos**
>
> Alguns dos melhores perigos são as opções de terrenos em _Draw Steel: Monstros_. Essas opções dinâmicas funcionam bem em um encontros de combate, mas você também pode usar muitas delas como perigos que os heróis precisam atravessar (como lagos de ácido e lava) ou lidar (como o obelisco negro) enquanto viajam de um lugar ao outro. Você pode usar esses perigos como são ou ajustá-los para combinarem com sua história. Por exemplo, você pode tornar o lago de ácido um lago de veneno ao substituir o Dano de Ácido por Dano de Veneno.

#### Gatilhos de Perigo Ativados

Todos os perigos ativados têm algum tipo de gatilho e os heróis devem poder fazer Testes - tipicamente de Razão ou Intuição - para perceber e desativar o gatilho. Quanto mais letal o perigo, mais difícil o Teste.

Se um herói não pensar em procurar por um gatilho antes de encontrar um perigo, você ainda pode pedir um Teste para que ele perceba o gatilho quando o perigo estiver prestes a ativar, desde que isso faça sentido. Se um herói está prestes a romper um fio que ativa um armadilha, você pode pedir um Teste de Intuição para que ele percebe o fio no momento em que pode ser claramente visto. Em caso de falha, o personagem rompe o fio e ativa a armadilha.

Uma vez que um gatilho seja percebido, os heróis podem ter uma chance de desabilitá-lo, se isso for possível. Você provavelmente não pode fazer nada além de reconstruir uma mina antiga para impedir que ela caia caso as paredes sofram dano, mas você pode desabilitar uma runa mágica que teletransporta quem pisa nela para o meio do oceano. Lembre que tentar desativar e falhar em fazer isso pode ativar o perigo!

#### Dano de Perigo

O dano causado por um perigo depende de dois fatores. Primeiro, quão letal você quer que o perigo seja? Você quer que ele só cause um pouco de dano ou deve custar uma ou duas Recuperações? Segundo, esse perigo é perpétuo ou ocorre apenas uma vez? Se é uma obstrução, responda a essa pergunta pensando se você espera que uma criatura seja razoavelmente capaz de sofrer dano da obstrução mais de uma vez. Se a resposta é sim, considere-o um perigo perpétuo em termos de dano. Se não, é um perigo de ocorrência única.

Um herói pode ter uma chance de mitigar dano de um perigo, como um Teste de Agilidade para fugir ou desviar de uma avalanche ou Teste de Razão para resistir ao dano psíquico de uma nuvem psiônica. Você pode decidir que tipo de Teste precisa ser feito com base nas circunstâncias.

As Tabelas de Letalidade de Perigos de Uso-único e de Letalidade de Perigos Perpétuos mostram o dano causado por perigos. Perigos são organizados por Nível, indicando sua ameaça relativa comparada ao Nível dos heróis. Cada exemplo tem três expressões de dano para resultados de Grau 1, Grau 2 e Grau 3 no Teste feito para reduzir o dano do perigo. Quanto pior o resultado do Teste, maior o dano.

#### Tabela de Letalidade de Perigos de Uso-único

| Nível | Nada Letal | Pouco Letal | Muito Letal |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1     | 7/5/3      | 9/7/5       | 11/9/7      |

| 10    | 14/11/7    | 19/16/12    | 24/21/17    |

#### Efeitos de Perigos

Alguns perigos causam efeitos além de ou em vez de dano. Um perigo que é parte de um encontro de combate pode impor quase qualquer efeito, incluindo Condições, e pode ter um impacto real na história. Entretanto, se os heróis estão enfrentando um perigo fora de combate, você precisa que quaisquer efeitos impostos sejam mais impactantes e duradouros. Os efeitos a seguir refletem as consequências interessantes e duradouras que um perigo fora de combate deve ter:

- Um personagem perde uma Recuperação.
- Uma maldição deixa um personagem com uma voz demoníaca que dá Desvantagem em Testes de Presença.
- Um personagem sofre um ferimento aberto que causa 1d10 pontos de dano sempre que tiver um 2 Natural ao lançar dados antes do próximo Descanso.
- Um personagem é teletransportado para o meio de um corpo de água próximo.

Mas embora consequências duradouras e interessantes sejam divertidas, tenha certeza de que isso não desvie da história ao ponto do jogo inteiro passar a ser sobre resolver problemas criados por um perigo - a não ser que seu grupo pense que isso é divertido!

### Criando e Dirigindo Interações

Cenas de interação são similares a cenas de exploração, exceto que os heróis obtém as informações e objetos que precisam ao falarem com um ou mais NPCs em vez de explorando uma área. Assim como um encontro de exploração, você fará uma lista das informações necessárias que os NPCs podem oferecer livremente aos heróis. Os NPCs podem então ter outras informações ou objetos que podem ser convencidos a fornecer aos heróis se apresentarem um argumento persuasivo, fizerem um favor ao NPC ou tiverem sucesso em um Teste.

Cenas de interação não são Negociações completas, as quais são reservadas para conversas que podem mudar uma aventura. Ainda assim, tenha em mente que NPCs diferentes podem reagir de maneira diferente a formas distintas de persuasão. Um covarde pode ser fácil de intimidar, enquanto um soldado experiente pode ser impossível de impressionar com exibições de ferocidade. Um suborno pode funcionar com um nobre corrupto, mas uma rainha bondosa que já tem riquezas inimagináveis provavelmente não tem interesse em quaisquer riquezas que os heróis possuam.

Consulte os detalhes que escreveu para seus NPCs ao interpretá-los. Tenha em mente quaisquer comportamentos ou atitudes distintas que puder incluir para tornar a cena divertida. Você não precisa ser um grande ator para criar uma cena de interação memorável! Simplesmente descrever como um NPC parece, soa e age já faz muito mesmo sem fazer vozes engraçadas. Se quiser fazer uma voz, vá em frente - mas não há obrigação nenhuma.

### Criando e Dirigindo Negociações

Quando estiver preparando uma Negociação (veja o Capítulo 11: Negociação), você vai querer escolher um NPC e dar a ele atributos de Negociação - um Interesse e Paciência iniciais, Motivações e Implicâncias, além de uma Opinião. A Tabela de Atitudes Iniciais no capítulo de Negociação deve dar uma ideia de onde começar com alguns desses atributos, mas sinta-se livre para ajustar os números conforme achar necessário.

Ao criar atributos de Negociação, mantenha as seguintes orientações em mente:

- Quanto mais alto o Interesse inicial de um personagem, mais provável que os heróis terminem a Negociação com tudo que querem - e mais ainda - do NPC.
- Quanto mais alta a Paciência inicial do personagem, mais tempo e mais chances os heróis terão para fazer argumentos. Se você quer uma Negociação mais longa, dê ao NPC uma Paciência maior.
- Quanto mais Motivações um NPC tem, mais provável que os heróis tenham Testes mais fáceis ao fazerem argumentos.
- Quanto mais Implicâncias o NPC tiver, é mais provável que os heróis tropecem em assuntos que comprometam a Negociação. Entretanto, muitas Implicâncias podem fazer os jogadores sentirem que a Negociação foi injusta, especialmente se eles não tiveram tempo para analisar o NPC antes de iniciar a Negociação.

#### Planeje os Resultados

É útil saber de antemão os vários resultados que um NPC pode oferecer durante uma Negociação. A continuação de uma aventura ou campanha nunca deve depender inteiramente do resultado de uma Negociação. Você não quer que a história pare por completo se os heróis falharem em obter informações, Tesouros ou ajuda de um NPC. Pode ser que a aventura fique muito mais difícil para eles, mas eles ainda devem ter opções para continuar quando suas habilidades de Negociação falharem.

Uma Negociação tem seis resultados possíveis, mas dois desses são pré-determinados. Se uma Negociação terminar com o NPC em Interesse 4, então os heróis conseguem o que queriam. Se a Negociação encerrar em Interesse 1, então o NPC não oferece nada. Mesmo com quatro opções totalmente abertas, entretanto, preparar resultados requer menos preparativos do que você pode imaginar.

> **Múltiplos NPCs**
>
> As regras de Negociação giram em torno da ideia de que os heróis estão encarando um único NPC dominante - um líder poderoso, um chefe diplomata, um general, um vilão importante e afins. Mas isso não quer dizer que não é possível dirigir uma Negociação onde os heróis interagem com um grupo de NPCs, cada um com formas ligeiramente diferentes de negociar.
>
> Se você preparar uma Negociação com mais de NPC, você não precisa dar para cada NPC um conjunto de atributos de Negociação, Motivações e Implicâncias. Em vez disso, você dá atributos para o grupo como um todo, para então fazer NPCs diferentes tomarem a iniciativa na Negociação quando uma Motivação ou Implicância em particular surgir. Por exemplo, se você der a Implicância de Ganância para um grupo de cavaleiros, o capitão bem-vestido pode até parecer aberto a um suborno, mas quando o sargento carrancudo, ressentido com o estilo de vida extravagante do capitão, rejeita a oferta dos personagens, o capitão precisa concordar para manter a paz entre os membros do grupo.

Se uma Negociação acabar com o Interesse do NPC em 2 ou 5, você precisa saber o que o NPC pode oferecer aos heróis em vez de ou em adição ao que eles pediram. É uma boa ideia também ter uma lista de dois favores, objetos, informações ou outra ajuda que o NPC pode oferecer aos heróis, para que você não precise improvisar algo quando esses resultados surgirem.

De igual maneira, se o Interesse do NPC terminar em 3, ele pedirá aos heróis um favor em troca do que está sendo pedido dele. Os heróis podem também perguntar diretamente ao NPC o que pode ser oferecido para facilitar a Negociação. Neste caso, é bom ter em mente dois favores, objetos, informações ou outra ajuda que o NPC pode pedir aos heróis.

Finalmente, se os heróis realmente ofenderem o NPC e terminarem a Negociação com Interesse 0, pense em algo que o NPC possa fazer para punir os heróis. Se você não tiver isso preparado, porém, não se preocupe. Vingança é um prato que se come frio - e talvez daqui a algumas sessões - então você tem tempo para planejar.

#### Atributos de Negociação de Heróis

Muitos heróis têm recursos de Classe, Títulos ou outras opções de personagem que os tornam melhores em Negociações. Ao preparar uma Negociação, é melhor que você saiba o Renome de cada herói e quaisquer recursos que tenham que possam impactar a Negociação, como o recurso de Parceiro de Cena do Trovador. Pergunte a seus jogadores se alguma das opções de personagem influencia Negociações no início da campanha e pergunte novamente toda vez que subirem de Nível.

#### Heróis Devem Iniciar

Uma Negociação sempre deve ser iniciada pelos heróis e o personagem (como pessoas, no geral) não pode ser forçado a negociar por algo que não quer. Enquanto preparar sua Negociação, lembre que os jogadores podem decidir ganhar o que os personagens precisam do NPC de outras maneiras - pedir um favor de alguém diferente que tem como ajudar, roubar o que precisam do NPC, simplesmente continuar sem a ajuda do NPC, etc.

#### Estrutura para Interpretação

Novos Diretores e jogadores podem se sentir um pouco sobrecarregados com Negociação, pensando se precisam das regras para interpretar uma discussão de troca de favores. Se você prefere jogar sem as regras de Negociação, vá em frente! Os designers de _Draw Steel_ não vão entrar na sua casa e tomar seus livros de você. Entretanto, as regras de Negociação existem para fornecer mecânicas robustas que criam uma dinâmica emocionante entre dois grupos, com riscos altos e drama.

O Interesse de um NPC pode ajudar a determinar a atitude dele em relação às propostas do grupo, enquanto sua Paciência indica quanto tempo está disposto a dar aos heróis. Da mesma maneira que Vigor informa quando um monstro está acabado na luta, Paciência informa quando um NPC cansou de conversar e está pronto para fazer uma oferta. As regras de Negociação significam que você nunca precisa só interpretar uma conversa até que você e os jogadores fiquem entediados com a cena, para que então alguém faça um único Teste para ver o que acontece. As regras de Negociação permitem interpretar com estrutura, riscos e recompensas!

A coisa mais importante a se lembrar a respeito de Negociação é que as regras devem existir para ajudar você - não para atrapalhar. Elas são flexíveis de propósito. Se um herói fizer um argumento excelente que você acha que deve funcionar sem um Teste, então é isso o que acontece. Se um herói faz um argumento infeliz que deve falhar, então azar o dele. Você tem o poder para dirigir uma Negociação da forma que for mais divertida para você e seus jogadores.

Se os jogadores estão com dificuldade em interpretar durante uma Negociação, tente fazer sua próxima Negociação sem anunciar que os personagens estão agora fazendo uma Negociação. Simplesmente peça Testes quando for apropriado e faça o NPC responder baseado nos resultados dos Testes, além de suas Motivações e Implicâncias. Esta abordagem pode ajudar seus jogadores a parar de focar nas regras e passar a apenas interpretar enquanto você monitora o Interesse e a Paciência.

#### Pesquisa e Reconhecimento

Se os jogadores quiserem negociar com um NPC e os heróis têm algum tempo antes da conversa começar, eles podem fazer um pouco de pesquisa e reconhecimento a respeito do NPC, esperando descobrir suas Motivações e Implicâncias. Personagens têm múltiplas formas de lidar com isso. Eles podem pesquisar a respeito do NPC como um projeto de tempo livre, eles podem fazer um Teste de Montagem para buscar rumores ou podem fazer favores a pessoas próximas do NPC para receber a informação.

Sempre é uma boa ideia deixar que os heróis façam um pouco de reconhecimento antes de pular para uma Negociação. Fazer isso torna a história mais rica e pode ajudar os jogadores a engajar mais com o sistema de Negociação, uma vez que estarão mais preparados para ela.

#### Interpretando Negociadores

Quando for a hora de interpretar um personagem em uma Negociação, lembre que o NPC, como todas as criaturas sapientes, é complexo. Cada NPC tem sua maneira própria de abordar uma Negociação. Alguns podem ser cheios de bravado. Outros podem dizer tudo com um sorriso, até quando rejeitam os heróis. Outros podem ser muito eloquentes, enquanto outros podem dizer o mínimo possível para manter os heróis na dúvida sobre seus reais interesses. Como um ponto de partida para pensar em como um NPC específico negocia, verifique suas anotações sobre o NPC que criou ao preparar a aventura, revisando sua voz, comportamentos e falhas, além de quaisquer motivações para ajudar ou negar os heróis.

Uma decisão importante para fazer de antemão é pensar no quão direto o NPC será sobre o que quer dos heróis. Um NPC direto pode tornar uma Negociação rápida, se os heróis estiverem dispostos a dar ao NPC o que ele quiser. Um NPC misterioso pode ser um quebra-cabeça a desvendar e pode ser mais difícil de interpretar. Se é sua primeira vez usando as regras de Negociação, comece com um personagem mais direto antes de interpretar um cliente tímido.

Durante a Negociação, deixe que os jogadores conversem livremente sobre sua estratégia se isso combinar com o estilo de jogo e senso de diversão deles. Você pode intervir se algum problema pessoal surgir, mas, fora isso, deixe que os jogadores planejem, conspirem e adivinhem enquanto você só observa.

Uma vez que a Negociação comece, eles só podem obter informações sobre o NPC fazendo Testes, usando os recursos dos personagens ou através de conversas com o NPC. Sempre que o NPC fizer uma oferta aos heróis depois de um Teste, torne os termos da oferta muito claros. Embora alguns NPCs possam falar de forma misteriosa, é melhor que os jogadores entendam no que estão se metendo. Pode ser divertido enganar os heróis, mas muitos jogadores não acham divertido quando eles são enganados.

> **Compartilhando Interesse e Paciência**
>
> Cabe a você como Diretor decidir compartilhar o Interesse ou Paciência de um NPC durante uma Negociação. Às vezes compartilhar essa informação pode tornar um encontro mais dramático, com os jogadores observando seu progresso ir e vir em tempo real. Outros grupos podem achar Negociação mais divertida, dramática e imersiva se os números exatos ficarem escondidos, assim como alguns grupos gostam de saber o Vigor de cada criatura em uma batalha e outros preferem que essa informação seja segredo. Fale com seus jogadores sobre o que eles preferem.

### Exemplos de Negociadores

Esta seção contém vários exemplos de NPCs que você pode usar para Negociação, ordenados conforme o valor de suas Opiniões. Cada um desses NPCs é um arquétipo que você pode adaptar facilmente para situações específicas. Por exemplo, o Chefe de Quadrilha pode ser o líder de uma gangue, um capitão pirata ou um rebelde que redistribui riqueza ao roubar os nobres corruptos para distribuir os bens aos menos afortunados.

Cada arquétipo inclui uma lista de Motivações e Implicâncias que um NPC pode ter. Você deve escolher pelo menos duas de cada lista para qualquer NPC que criar usando o arquétipo. Sinta-se livre para mudar a descrição das Motivações e Implicâncias ou ajustar os números conforme adequado.

#### **Chefe de Quadrilha - Opinião: 1**

_O chefe de quadrilha é um valentão e fanfarrão, com a maioria negociando com intimidação e bravado antes de amolecer._

**Motivações**
O chefe de quadrilha pode ter as Motivações a seguir:

- **Liberdade**: ninguém me fala o que fazer - não se quiserem manter a cabeça em cima dos ombros. E ninguém diz aos meus lacaios o que fazer, exceto EU!
- **Ganância**: ouro! Eu amo a sensação de moedas tilintantes e brilhantes nas mãos. Eu nunca achei nada para comprar que eu gostasse mais do que ter o ouro em si.
- **Poder**: eu quero um esconderijo mais forte, mais lacaios e maior parte dos espólios. Arranje isso e eu faço seu trabalho sujo. Você pode ficar com seus títulos e terras.
- **Folia**: se você não ficar bêbado depois de uma batalha, então por que ter uma batalha?

**Implicâncias**
O chefe de quadrilha pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Autoridade Superior**: por ordem do barão? Pode ficar com seus títulos chiques e terras. Eu dou as ordens aqui!
- **Justiça**: só os fracos pedem justiça. Os fortes fazem suas próprias regras.
- **Legado**: olha, não ligo pro que acontecer quando eu morrer. Eu quero que meus lacaios gritem meu nome agora, não daqui cem anos.
- **Paz**: em tempos de paz, você pega uma moeda que não é sua e o xerife vem bater na sua porta. Na guerra, caravanas inteiras desaparecem e ninguém liga. Prefiro a guerra.

#### **Cavaleiro - Opinião: 2**

_Embora não seja um idealista, o cavaleiro é um servo leal do seu senhor e segue as regras. O cavaleiro sabe seu lugar na sociedade e acredita que todos devem ficar no seu lugar._

**Implicâncias**
O cavaleiro pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Benevolência**: essas pessoas não precisam de caridade, elas precisam de ordem. Deixe irem até o conselho e elas terão sua fome saciada em troca de um dia de trabalho honesto.
- **Liberdade**: ninguém é livre, desde o mais baixo servo até em cima. Até um monarca tem um dever com seu povo.
- **Poder**: meu poder vem do meu juramento, não de um acordo feito em segredo.
- **Vingança**: eu acredito em justiça, não vingança, e ordem é decidida pelas cortes. Eu sou apenas um funcionário.

#### **Mestre de Guilda - Opinião: 3**

_O mestre de guilda sabe o valor do dinheiro, mas entende que conhecimento - tanto informação privilegiada quanto segredos de ofício - é a moeda mais valiosa que existe. Ele barganha de acordo._

O arquétipo do mestre de guilda pode ser usado para qualquer fonte de informações locais, como líder de um culto, bruxa ou espião.

**Motivações**
O mestre de guilda pode ter as Motivações a seguir:

- **Benevolência**: o povo não pode cuidar de si mesmo. Alguém tem que cuidar deles, pobrezinhos.

- **Poder**: quem você pensa que estará no comando na próxima era? Os nobres? Bah! Eles ainda contam riqueza em vacas. Não, quem controla informação irá mandar no mundo - e eu pretendo estar lá.
- **Proteção**: nós temos rivais - oportunistas gananciosos que não param por nada. Se eu quiser proteger minha guilda, tenho que acabar com eles antes que acabem conosco.

**Implicâncias**
O mestre de guilda pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Autoridade Superior**: minha lealdade é com a guilda - não com o prefeito, não com o rei, nem com o próprio Ajax. Mas não diga a eles que eu disse isso.
- **Justiça**: estamos moldando o mundo aqui. Claro, algumas pessoas que não conseguirem se adaptar vão ficar por baixo. Mas por que alguém nos culparia por isso?
- **Paz**: conflito não ruim por si só. Ele gera inovação. A chave é não estar do lado dos perdedores.
- **Folia**: eu não tenho tempo para tolices. Venha falar comigo de novo quando tiver algo de valor para me mostrar.

#### **Chefe Militar - Opinião: 4**

_O chefe militar ergueu seu estandarte e tropas vêm à sua causa. Alguns dizem que eles nunca negociam, mas isso não é verdade. Eles ficam felizes em ouvir os termos de uma rendição._

O arquétipo do caudilho pode ser usado para qualquer ameaça local, como um vampiro, chefe hobgoblin ou nobre rebelde.

**Motivações**
O chefe militar pode ter as Motivações a seguir:

- **Paz**: olhe ao seu redor. Para onde quer que olhe - fraqueza, corrupção, desperdício. Paz é um objetivo nobre, mas não teremos paz até que o regime atual seja derrotado.
- **Vingança**: você sofreu como eu nas mãos daquele vilão? Então eu alegremente lhe chamo de amigo.

**Implicâncias**
O chefe militar pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Benevolência**: vá para sua esquina e peça esmola se é isso que quer. Você não conseguirá nenhuma comigo.
- **Descoberta**: o que isso tem a ver comigo? Sou um soldado, não um sábio.
- **Justiça**: você ousa me chamar de injusto? Eu faço as leis aqui. A justiça é minha para dar ou tirar!
- **Proteção**: não sou um covarde que implora por proteção e minhas tropas também não são. Quem quer que peça por segurança não a merece.

- **Justiça**: a lei deve ser preservada. Se você tiver provas de algum crime, os responsáveis devem ser punidos.

**Implicâncias**
O burgomestre pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Descoberta**: confie em mim. Nada de bom virá de cutucar esse vespeiro em particular.
- **Liberdade**: liberdade, hein? O que vem depois, liberdade de impostos? Ninguém nasce livre exceto os deuses e só tolos pensam de outra forma.
- **Folia**: guarde essa garrafa. Eu sou uma figura pública! Não posso ser visto festejando e pulando e fazendo sabe mais o que.
- **Vingança**: na política, é necessário ter uma memória ruim. Seu inimigo hoje pode ser seu aliado amanhã. Não há necessidade de tornar as coisas pessoais.

#### **Virtuoso - Opinião: 6**

- **Folia**: sim, festejemos esta noite! Inspiração olha com gentileza por aqueles que bebem da vida até a última gota.

**Implicâncias**
O virtuoso pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Ganância**: você me oferece dinheiro? Dinheiro vai até os gênios - nos é devido. Eu consigo isso com milhares de admiradores.
- **Poder**: não tenho ambições além deste teatro de ópera. Deixar este lugar, mesmo por um palácio ou trono...seria um exílio para mim.
- **Proteção**: não tenho medo. A deusa da música cuida dos seus.
- **Vingança**: talvez existam alguns que me odeiam...alguns que pensam que estou no caminho ou cujas conquistas ofusquei. Mas não odeio nem tenho inveja de ninguém.

#### **Alto Sacerdote - Opinião: 7**

_O alto sacerdote pode ser um membro com cargo alto na sua fé, mas, como ele lhe dirá rapidamente, ele não é livre para fazer o que quiser. Os comandos de sua divindade são supremos._

O arquétipo do alto sacerdote pode ser usado para qualquer autoridade nacional, como conde, juiz ou general.

- **Justiça:** fique tranquilo que os bons receberão sua recompensa e os maus serão punidos. Eu garantirei isto.

**Implicâncias**
O alto sacerdote pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Ganância**: não me ofereça isso. Doe para a fé, se você não tem outro uso para isso.
- **Legado**: eu? Não sou ninguém. Meus bons atos, se tenho algum, são crédito de minha divindade, não meus.
- **Poder**: minhas responsabilidades atuais bastam. Não tenho desejo de mais.
- **Folia**: que vergonha! Você se gaba de fazer o mal e espera que eu participe?

#### **Duque - Opinião: 8**

_Conforme o duque faz um gesto para que se junte à mesa dele, espiões sussurram no ouvido dele. O duque nunca joga um jogo ou entra em uma negociação a menos que pense que pode ter a carta mais alta._

- **Ganância**: guarde seu ouro. Sou ocupado demais para gastá-lo.
- **Justiça**: certo e errado? Não há certo, exceto o que fortalece o reino, e não há errado, exceto o que o danifique.
- **Proteção**: não ligo para salvar vidas. Todos estamos condenados a morrer. A questão é o que viverá depois de nós.

_O poder tremendo do dragão é ofuscado apenas por sua ilimitada ambição e orgulho._

#### **Monarca - Opinião: 10**

_Sejam bons, sejam maus, monarcas estão acostumados com autoridade - e querem mantê-la. Eles respondem melhor a pedidos do que exigências._

**Motivações**
O monarca pode ter as Motivações a seguir:

- **Vingança**: vingança é um esporte excitante. Infelizmente, é um que deixei para trás. É política, não vingança, que governa aqui.

#### **Lich - Opinião: 11**

_O lich passou séculos sozinho, estudando e acumulando seu poder...mas agora a hora de estudar acabou._

O lich está disposto a negociar com heróis poderosos que podem se tornar tenentes leais - ou servos mortos-vivos poderosos se as negociações não forem boas.

- **Proteção**: se você está tão disposto a salvar vidas, curve-se a mim! Nenhum mal atingirá meus servos.

#### **Divindade - Opinião: 12**

_A divindade escutará suas orações - e talvez até responda a elas, se tiver vontade de fazê-lo._

O arquétipo da divindade pode ser usado para qualquer poder que transcenda o mundo, como o lendário dragão do tempo Cthrion Uroniziir ou o faraó terrível Khorsekhef, o Infinito.

**Motivações**

- **Benevolência**: não se preocupe, pois enviei campeões para salvar o mundo. Talvez esses campeões...estejam mais próximos do que você pensa.
- **Legado**: quando este abençoado dia chegar, todos virão a mim para rezar e oferecerei minhas bençãos ao mundo!
- **Poder**: embora onipotente no reino espiritual, minhas mãos estão atadas para questões tão mundanas. Mas se agir por mim, posso oferecer assistência.
- **Proteção**: tenha fé, pequeno...ninguém será esquecido ou deixado para trás.

A divindade pode ter as Implicâncias a seguir:

- **Ganância**: tolo! Você busca me oferecer o que é meu?
- **Autoridade Superior**: de quem você fala? Quem está além de mim, quem está acima de mim? Quem viverá para me ver morrer e quem respirou antes que eu lhe desse o fôlego? Que eles deem um passo a frente e se apresentem!
-

### Criando e Dirigindo Testes de Montagem

Você pode usar Testes de Montagem para perseguições, fugas, investigações viagem em regiões inóspitas, rastrear outras criaturas e qualquer momento excitante na história que possa ser contado com transições ou cortes entre os heróis.

#### Preparando Testes de Montagem

Ao preparar um Teste de Montagem, você precisará escrever algumas informações importantes.

Primeiro, faça uma lista de potenciais desafios que os heróis enfrentam durante o Teste de Montagem. Esta lista de desafios deve ser pelo menos tão longa quanto o número de sucessos que os heróis precisam para ter sucesso total. Você pode também preparar uma lista de consequências e recompensas que podem surgir para Testes individuais feitos durante o Teste de Montagem, mas como você não pode prever as abordagens dos jogadores para os Testes, não se preocupe em cobrir cada cenário. Você sempre pode usar ganhos de Malícia ou dar Vales Heroicos como consequências e recompensas padrões (veja Resultados de Testes no Capítulo 9: Testes).

Então você precisará criar três resultados para o Teste de Montagem: sucesso total, sucesso parcial e fracasso total. Em um sucesso total, os heróis devem conseguir tudo o que queriam. Em um sucesso parcial, eles devem conseguir o que queriam, mas pagando um preço, criando um novo problema para si depois de fazer o que queriam ou não conquistando exatamente os objetivos que queriam. Em um fracasso total, eles falham em conseguir o que queriam, mas isso não pode impedir a história. Talvez tenham perdido o rastro dos lacaios em fuga, mas sabem que podem invadir a torre de um mago para obter essa informação. Mesmo que a falha possa custar muito a eles, eles ainda devem ter opções para continuar a aventura.

#### Dirigindo Testes de Montagem

Ao dirigir um Teste de Montagem, comece definindo a cena para os jogadores e listando os vários desafios que os heróis devem superar. Permita que os jogadores formem uma estratégia sobre a ordem na qual irão abordar esses desafios e fazer Testes.

Ao julgar os Testes individuais como parte de um Teste de Montagem, faça como faria com qualquer outro Teste (veja Julgando Testes no Capítulo 9). Testes individuais devem ter recompensas e consequências quando apropriado. Além das opções usuais de recompensas ou consequências, você pode escolher que esses resultados deem Vantagem ou Desvantagem em um Teste posterior que faça parte do Teste de Montagem. Faça o que fizer sentido para as ações dos heróis na narrativa.

Depois de cada Teste, descreva as falhas ou sucessos dos heróis de forma que outros jogadores entendam se e como o desafio foi superado. Sua descrição pode até dar novas ideias para o que os personagens podem fazer em seguida.

Se um herói decide abordar um problema usando uma de suas Habilidade, Traços ou outros recursos em vez de um Teste e fizer sentido que o façam, permita o uso. Em muitos casos, você pode tratar essa abordagem como um sucesso automático que permite que o grupo supere um dos desafios do Teste de Montagem, mas você pode decidir que existem consequências desse sucesso. Outra opção é que o uso de uma Habilidade ou Traço é benéfico o suficiente para dar uma Vantagem em um Teste futuro ou tão efetivo que conte como múltiplos sucessos ao ponto de resolver o Teste de Montagem de uma vez só! Sempre recompense ações espertas dos jogadores.

No fim do Teste de Montagem, narre o resultado para os jogadores e descreva o sucesso ou falha, além de quaisquer consequências. Então você pode informar que o Teste de Montagem acabou!

#### Reviravolta de Montagem!

Você pode separar os Testes individuais em um Teste de Montagem ao introduzir um encontro de Combate rápido, Negociação, armadilha ou mais desafios a superar na cena. Monitore os sucessos e fracassos dos heróis para decidir quantos Testes precisam fazer antes de introduzir sua reviravolta. Geralmente, uma única reviravolta em um Teste de Montagem pode ser introduzida ao final da primeira ronda de Teste de Montagem. Confirme que os jogadores entendam que o Teste de Montagem está em pausa, mas não foi finalizado. Depois que a reviravolta estiver estabelecida e resolvida, continue com o Teste de Montagem.

### Exemplos de Testes de Montagem

Você pode usar quaisquer dos exemplos de Testes de Montagem a seguir no seu jogo ou usá-los como inspiração para modificar como quiser.

#### Enfrentar Incêndio

Fogo se espalha pelo vilarejo! Os heróis devem prevenir que ele se espalhe mais ainda enquanto salvam o máximo de pessoas possíveis. Seus esforços podem ser mais complicados se a causa do fogo - como um dragão ou exército invasor - ainda estiver por perto.

##### **Definido a Cena**

Fogo se alastra em várias construções e os ocupantes precisam ser resgatados. Em outros locais, algumas pessoas fogem enquanto outras jogam água no fogo sem qualquer organização ou plano. Sem liderança e um jeito de parar o incêndio, o fogo pode facilmente consumir tudo. Em um estábulo próximo, os cavalos entram em pânico conforme a palha começa a arder. Destroços em chamas bloqueiam caminhos por toda parte.

##### **Desafios de Montagem**

Os seguintes desafios podem ser parte do Teste de Montagem:

**Filas de Baldes**: personagens podem organizar os então bombeiros em brigadas disciplinadas de baldes ou podem combater as chamas de outra maneira. _Características sugeridas_: Presença, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Arquitetura, Intimidar, Liderar.

**Abrir um Corta-fogo**: previna que o fogo se espalhe ao remover materiais inflamáveis, seja movendo-os ou queimando-os de forma controlada. _Características sugeridas_: Músculo, Razão. _Perícias e Habilidades sugeridas_: Resiliência, Levantar, Habilidades com Dano de Fogo. _Especial_: Uma criatura perde uma Recuperação se tiver uma consequência no Teste deste desafio.

**Evacuar Construções:** os personagens precisam salvar pessoas presas em construções em chamas. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Escalar, Resiliência, Persuadir. _Especial:_ Uma criatura que não tiver Imunidade a Fogo perde uma Recuperação se tiver uma consequência no Teste deste desafio. Os heróis pode tentar esse desafio duas vezes durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Recrutar mais Bombeiros:** ao encontrar grupos que não estão enfrentando o fogo, como civis em fuga, os personagens podem convencê-los a ajudar. _Característica sugerida:_ Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Intimidar, Liderar, Persuadir.

**Libertar os Cavalos:** os personagens podem soltar os cavalos do estábulo que estão ameaçados pelo fogo e levá-los a um lugar seguro. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Trato Animal, Levantar, Montar.

**Mover Destroços em Chamas:** mover destroços incendiados que bloqueiam passagens podem permitir que pessoas fujam das chamas. _Característica sugerida:_ Músculo. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Resiliência, Levantar. _Especial:_ Uma criatura que não tenha Imunidade a Fogo perde uma Recuperação se tiver uma consequência no Teste deste desafio.

**Usar os Cavalos Libertos (se o desafio de Libertar os Cavalos foi bem-sucedido):** personagens podem usar os cavalos para mover destroços ou levar pessoas a locais seguros. _Características sugeridas:_ Razão, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Conduzir, Trato Animal, Montar.

##### **Reviravoltas Opcionais**

Ao final da primeira ronda do Teste de Montagem, surge uma emergência. Um ou mais heróis, escolhidos pelos jogadores, devem lidar com a situação até o fim da ronda. Se os heróis lidarem com a reviravolta com sucesso, eles ganham um sucesso no Teste de Montagem. Caso contrário, eles ganham uma falha.

**Colapso de Construção:** enquanto um herói está dentro ou próximo de uma construção, ela começa a ruir. O herói precisa escapar antes que a construção seja destruída. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Intuição. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Escalar, Ginástica, Pular.

**Causa do Fogo:** ao final da primeira ronda do Teste de Montagem, surge a causa hostil do fogo - um esquadrão de um exército invasor, um dragão, um grupo de arsonistas, etc. Os personagens devem iniciar um Encontro Padrão ou Difícil contra esta ameaça.

**Socorro!** Aldeões estão prestes a entrar em uma construção em chamas para salvar um parente preso. Esta reviravolta requer dois Testes, cada um dando um sucesso ou falha para o Teste de Montagem. Um herói pode tentar evitar que as pessoas entrem na construção enquanto outro herói resgata o parente. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Levantar, Persuadir.

##### Resultados do Teste de Montagem

Um dos seguintes resultados encerra o Teste de Montagem:

**Sucesso total:** o fogo é extingo. Construções estão danificadas, mas nenhuma vida foi perdida. Cada personagem ganha 2 Vitórias se o Teste de Montagem foi difícil ou 1 Vitória se foi fácil ou médio, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Sucesso parcial:** o fogo foi apagado, embora muitas construções tenham sido destruídas e algumas vidas tenham sido perdidas. Cada personagem ganha 1 Vitória se o Teste de Montagem foi médio ou difícil, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Falha total:** quando o fogo finalmente se apaga, a cidade está em ruínas. As pessoas estão de luto por seus mortos ou se preparam amargamente para encontrar um novo lar. Os personagens não recebem Vitórias pelo Teste de Montagem, mas podem receber Vitórias por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

#### Infiltrar o Palácio

Estejam os heróis tentando chegar na sala do trono de um tirano, realizar um assalto ousado ou resgatar uma figura da realeza em cativeiro, eles estão onde não deveriam - e gostariam de manter sua presença em segredo.

##### Definindo a Cena

O palácio é bem protegido, com patrulhas externas sempre em alerta. As poucas entradas óbvias são trancadas e vigiadas. Além disso, uma vez que o grupo esteja dentro do palácio, ninguém sabe o caminho até o objetivo. Guardas patrulham o interior do lugar também, forçando os personagens a serem furtivos ou blefarem para criar caminho.

##### Desafios de Montagem

Metade do trabalho de qualquer infiltração bem-sucedida é feito antes de entrar no lugar. Os jogadores podem escolher que os heróis façam Testes individuais como parte do Teste de Montagem antes de tentarem entrar no palácio. Uma ronda de Testes pode ser feita desta maneira, sem que nenhum desses Testes influencie o nível de alarme do palácio (veja a seguir).

Os seguintes desafios podem ser parte deste preparo inicial:

**Subornar Guardas:** os heróis podem pagar os guardas externos para que olhem para o outro lado. Se bem-sucedidos, a Riqueza de um ou mais heróis é reduzida em 1 ponto. _Característica sugerida:_ Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Criminalidade, Flertar, Persuadir.

**Encontrar Esquemas:** procurar entradas secretas e passagens pouco conhecidas pode ser feito em bibliotecas esquecidas ou prefeituras bem-vigiadas. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Arquitetura, História, Esgueirar.

**Identificar Entradas Desprotegidas:** olhar os arredores ou consultar contatos pode revelar uma porta dos fundos esquecida ou janela acessível. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Intuição. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Atenção, Arquitetura, Criminalidade.

**Aprender Rotina dos Guardas:** ao manter seus olhos e ouvidos atentos, personagens podem aprender quando os guardas encerram seus turnos. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Atenção, Bisbilhotar, Rastrear.

**Usar Identidades Falsas:** ao produzir documentos ou insígnias falsificados, personagens podem se preparar para andar pelo palácio a olhos vistos. _Características sugeridas:_ Presença, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Disfarce, Falsificação, Mentir.

Quando os heróis começarem sua infiltração, o nível de alarme do palácio começa em 0. Enquanto se infiltram no local, sempre que um herói falhar em um Teste como parte do Teste de Montagem, o nível de alarme aumenta em 1, até um máximo de 2. Cada vez que os heróis tiverem sucesso em um Teste, o nível de alarme reduz, até um mínimo de 0. Enquanto o nível de alarme for 1, Testes feitos dentro do palácio como parte do Teste de Montagem têm Desvantagem. Quando o nível de alarme for 2, esses Testes possuem desvantagem dupla.

A primeira vez que qualquer herói falhar em um Teste como parte do Teste de Montagem enquanto o nível de alarme for 2, ele encontra guardas e deve iniciar um encontro de combate difícil. A segunda vez que qualquer herói falhar em um Teste com o nível de alarme em 2, o Teste de Montagem resulta em uma falha total.

Os desafios a seguir podem ser parte da infiltração dos heróis:

**Rota Aérea:** os personagens podem seguir um caminho que passa por passarelas ou saliências elevadas. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Músculo. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Escalar, Ginástica, Pular.

**Evitar Tráfego:** ao buscar as áreas mais empoeiradas, menos utilizadas e ficando nelas, os heróis podem evitar serem percebidos. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Navegação, Procurar, Rastrear.

**Ficar Quieto:** uma vez que o nível de alarme esteja acima de 0, os heróis podem encontrar um lugar para ficarem escondidos por um tempo, reduzindo o nível de alarme em 1 ponto. Esta atividade não requer um Teste nem gera um sucesso ou falha.

**Criar uma Distração:** depois de causar uma comoção, os personagens rapidamente seguem para o outro lado. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Alquimia, Atuar, Sabotar.

**Fingir de Guardas:** usar uniformes roubados ou preparados de antemão pode permitir que os personagens andem livremente pelo palácio. O Teste para este desafio ganha uma Vantagem se os personagens prepararam disfarces de antemão (incluindo ter sucesso no desafio de Usar Identidades Falsas) ou derrotaram guardas durante sua infiltração. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Disfarce, Mentir, Procurar.

**Ficar nas Sombras:** ficar fora de vista é a forma mais simples para os personagens se moverem pelo palácio. _Característica sugerida:_ Agilidade. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Esconder-se, Esgueirar. _Especial:_ os heróis podem tentar este desafio duas vezes durante o Teste de Montagem.

##### Reviravoltas Opcionais

A qualquer momento durante a seção de infiltração do Teste de Montagem, imediatamente depois do turno de um herói, os personagens podem encontrar outro grupo que também está se infiltrando no palácio e possivelmente estão atrás do mesmo prêmio. Os personagens podem escolher lutar, negociar com o outro grupo, ou deixá-los passar - o que pode significar encontrá-los de novo quando alcançarem seu objetivo final.

##### Resultados de Teste de Montagem

Um dos seguintes resultados encerra o Teste de Montagem:

**Sucesso total:** os heróis alcançam seu objetivo e asseguram uma rota de fuga que os deixa sair do palácio em segurança. Cada personagem ganha 2 Vitórias se o Teste de Montagem foi difícil ou 1 Vitória se foi fácil ou médio, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas em combate durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Sucesso parcial:** os personagens alcançam seu objetivo, mas precisam vencer um encontro de combate padrão para fugir do palácio. Cada personagem ganha 1 Vitória se o Teste de Montagem foi médio ou difícil, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas em combate durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Falha total:** o palácio entra em alerta total e o objetivo dos heróis fica fora de alcance. Os personagens não ganham Vitórias pelo Teste de Montagem, mas podem receber Vitórias de combates que ocorreram durante o Teste de Montagem.

#### Preparar para Batalha

Seja uma vila ameaçada por bandidos, seja uma grande cidade se preparando para um cerco, inimigos estão a caminho e prontos para atacar. Os heróis têm tempo limitado para fortificar as defesas do local e animar as tropas.

###### Definindo a Cena

As muralhas ou paliçadas ao redor do povoado estão em más condições (se sequer existirem). Estradas ou rios pela área dão aos invasores livre acesso ao povoado a menos que barricadas, armadilhas ou emboscadas sejam preparadas. Suprimentos de comida, armas e munição estão baixos demais para durar um cerco longo. A área é lar de poucos combatentes experientes comparados aos invasores e a milícia local tem poucos equipamentos e experiência.

###### Desafios de Montagem

Os seguintes desafios podem ser parte do Teste de Montagem:

**Armas e Armadura:** produzir ou reparar armas e armaduras de todos os tipos pode ajudar a recompor os estoques da defesa. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Alquimia, Forja, Flecharia.

**Evacuação:** os heróis podem ajudar os não-combatentes a ficarem seguros antes dos invasores chegarem. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Trato Animal, Liderar, Persuadir.

**Fortificação:** os personagens podem ajudar a construir ou reparar as muralhas ou outras estruturas de defesa. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Arquitetura, Resiliência, Levantar.

**Inspiração:** melhorar o ânimo com discursos inspiradores ou apresentações pode preparar os nativos para a luta que está por vir. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Gabar-se, Liderar, Atuar.

**Propaganda:** os personagens podem tentar semear confusão ou rebelião nas tropas do exército que se aproxima. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Disfarce, Falsificação, Mentir.

**Reservas:** os personagens podem caçar, colher ou conjurar comida e água com magia para aumentar os suprimentos do povoado. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Natureza, Esgueirar, Rastrear.

**Treinamento:** os heróis podem ajudar a treinar os defensores do povoado. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Resiliência, Intimidar, Liderar.

**Armadilhas:** cavar poços escondidos, colocar obstáculos e preparar emboscadas tornará mais difícil para que os invasores se aproximem do povoado. _Características sugeridas:_ Músculo, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Ocultar Objeto, Resiliência, Mecânica.

##### Reviravoltas Opcionais

No final da primeira ronda do Teste de Montagem, uma vanguarda rápida do inimigo ataca antes que os defensores do povoado estejam prontos. Os heróis devem enfrentar um encontro de combate fácil.

##### Resultados do Teste de Montagem

Um dos resultados a seguir encerra o Teste de Montagem:

**Sucesso total:** o povoado é totalmente fortificado e, mesmo que os heróis não lutem em sua defesa, o povo e as estruturas sobreviverão. Se os heróis quiserem, podem deixar o povoado e lutar um encontro de combate padrão contra o líder dos invasores com seus lacaios, possivelmente matando ou capturando o líder. Cada personagem ganha 2 Vitórias se o Teste de Montagem foi difícil ou 1 Vitória se foi fácil ou médio, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Sucesso parcial:** as fortificações do povoado foram melhoradas, mas ele não resistirá se os heróis lutarem em sua defesa. Para salvar o povoado, os heróis devem triunfar em um encontro de combate difícil contra o líder dos invasores com seus lacaios. Se os heróis perderem, o povoado é destruído. Cada personagem ganha 1 Vitória se o Teste de Montagem foi difícil ou médio, além de quaisquer Vitórias por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Falha total:** os heróis perdem uma Recuperação por seus esforços fracassados em defender o povoado, que é tomado pelos invasores. Se os jogadores quiserem, os personagens podem enfrentar dois encontros de combate difíceis contra ondas de invasores para permitir que alguns dos habitantes fujam em segurança. Os personagens não recebem Vitórias pelo Teste de Montagem, mas podem receber Vitórias por combates travados durante o Teste de Montagem.

#### Rastrear o Fugitivo

Os heróis estão seguindo os rastros de alguém. Um criminoso fugitivo? Uma fera perigosa? Uma criança perdida ou sequestrada? As dificuldades da perseguição dependem se o alvo sabe que está sendo perseguido e se quer ser encontrado.

##### Definindo a Cena

A rota do fugitivo é fácil de seguir, mas seria essa uma trilha falsa? Será que alguém o viu passar e há qualquer ideia de para onde pode estar indo? O objetivo é que os personagens façam o que puderem para continuar nos rastros do fugitivo.

##### Desafios de Montagem

Os seguintes desafios podem ser parte do Teste de Montagem:

**Perguntar:** personagens podem obter pistas de nativos e transeuntes - ou, se tiverem acesso à magia adequada, dos animais e dos mortos. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Interrogar, Persuadir, Boatos.

**Seguir os Rastros:** buscar rastros ou outros sinais da passagem do fugitivo pode levar os personagens adiante. _Característica sugerida:_ Intuição. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Atenção, Procurar, Rastrear. _Especial:_ os heróis podem tentar este desafio duas vezes durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Ter uma Visão Melhor:** os personagens podem subir a locais altos para ver os arredores de para onde o fugitivo pode estar indo. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Músculo. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Escalar, Ginástica, Pular.

**Prever o Próximo Movimento:** os heróis podem ter uma ideia de para onde o alvo está indo. Um personagem ganha Vantagem no Teste desse desafio se conhecer bem o alvo. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Navegação, Ler Pessoas, uma Perícia adequada do Grupo de Perícias de Conhecimento (Natureza para seguir um animal, Criminalidade para seguir um criminoso, etc.).

**Marcha Forçada:** enquanto o alvo estiver descansando, os heróis têm uma chance de se aproximar. _Característica sugerida:_ Músculo. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Conduzir, Resiliência, Navegação, Montar. _Especial:_ o herói fazendo o Teste deste desafio perde uma Recuperação.

##### Reviravoltas Opcionais

Ao final da primeira ronda do Teste de Montagem, os heróis encontram uma armadilha ou problema deixado pelo alvo. Isto pode incluir coisas como um poço com estacas envenenadas, um grupo de nativos irados que foram informados de que os personagens são criminosos ou um incêndio provocado. Os heróis precisam lidar com a armadilha ou problema antes que possam seguir com o Teste de Montagem.

##### Resultados do Teste de Montagem

Um dos resultados a seguir encerra o Teste de Montagem:

**Sucesso total:** os heróis alcançam seu objetivo antes que o fugitivo chegue a seu destino ou antes que uma criatura sequestrada ou perdida fique machucada. Cada personagem ganha 2 Vitórias se o Teste de Montagem foi difícil ou 1 Vitória se foi fácil ou médio, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas de combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Sucesso parcial:** se o alvo estava tentando evitar a captura, ele alcança seu destino. Ele encontra aliados e uma posição fortificada com a qual se defender ou pode ter mais tempo para causar mais dano. Se o alvo estava perdido ou sequestrado, ele está seriamente ferido quando encontrado. Cada personagem ganha uma Vitória se o Teste de Montagem foi médio ou difícil, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Falha total:** os rastros desaparecem e os heróis precisarão buscar novas pistas ou uma nova abordagem antes de poderem voltar à procura. Os personagens não ganham Vitórias pelo Teste de Montagem, mas recebem Vitórias por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

#### Corrida Selvagem

Os heróis precisam atravessar uma área selvagem, talvez para alcançar uma cidade cercada antes que seja invadida ou para buscar o local onde uma maldição está prestes a entrar em efeito. Chegar lá rápido é uma prioridade - mas chegar vivo também é.

##### Definindo a Cena

O território selvagem tem perigos desconhecidos. Os personagens precisam encontrar o melhor caminho enquanto mantém um bom ritmo, ficam de olho em perigos e evitam predadores.

##### Desafios de Montagem

Os desafios a seguir podem ser parte do Teste de Montagem:

**Evitar Perigos:** os personagens podem determinar formas de superar os perigos naturais do território, como usar ervas que repelem insetos em um pântano ou fazer sapatos para neve em uma tundra. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Curar, Natureza, uma Perícia adequada do Grupo de Perícias de Criação (como Alquimia para fazer o repelente).

**Carregar Bagagem:** ao carregar os suprimentos para membros mais fracos do grupo, os personagens podem aumentar a velocidade do grupo inteiro. _Característica sugerida:_ Músculo. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Resiliência, Levantar.

**Encontrar o Caminho:** evitar se perder é um grande desafio para os personagens. _Características sugeridas:_ Intuição, Razão. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Atenção, Natureza, Navegação.

**Manter o Ânimo:** os personagens podem manter o ânimo do grupo durante uma marcha forçada com canções e música. _Característica sugerida:_ Presença. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Liderar, Música, Atuar.

**Manter Vigia:** os personagens precisam ficar de olhos atentos para o perigo. _Característica sugerida:_ Intuição. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Atenção, Bisbilhotar, Rastrear.

**Marcha Forçada:** os personagens precisam estar prontos para aumentar o ritmo e ir além do cansaço. _Característica sugerida:_ Músculo. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Resiliência, Liderar, Conduzir, Trato Animal ou Montar, se o grupo tiver montarias ou veículos.

**Bater Terreno:** investigar o caminho adiante permite que os personagens evitem bloqueios e terreno difícil. _Características sugeridas:_ Agilidade, Intuição. _Perícias sugeridas:_ Atenção, Navegação, Esgueirar.

###### Reviravoltas Opcionais

Ao final da primeira ronda do Teste de Montagem, a jornada os personagens é interrompida por uma das seguintes ameaças:

**Monstro Predatório:** os personagens encontram ou são perseguidos por um predador monstruoso, devendo iniciar um encontro de combate padrão para superar a ameaça ou afugentá-la. Se algum personagem teve sucesso no desafio de Bater Terreno, você pode permitir que os personagens façam um Teste em Grupo para passar furtivamente pelo monstro ou preparar uma emboscada.

**Perigo Inesperado:** um perigo natural como uma avalanche, deslizamento ou incêndio interrompe a jornada. Cada herói deve fazer um Teste de sua escolha para evitar o perigo, perdendo uma Recuperação em caso de falha.

###### Resultados do Teste de Montagem

Um dos seguintes resultados encerra o Teste de Montagem:

**Sucesso total:** os heróis chegam ao seu destino a tempo. Cada personagem ganha 2 Vitórias se o Teste de Montagem foi difícil ou 1 Vitória se foi fácil ou médio, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Sucesso parcial:** para alcançar seu destino a tempo, os heróis devem correr muito na última porção da jornada, com cada personagem gastando 2 Recuperações para fazê-lo. (Se sequer um personagem não tiver 2 Recuperações sobrando, os personagens sofrem uma falha total no Teste de Montagem). Cada personagem ganha 1 Vitória se o Teste de Montagem foi médio ou difícil, além de quaisquer Vitórias recebidas em combate durante o Teste de Montagem.

**Falha total:** os heróis não chegam a tempo de evitar a catástrofe. Os personagens não ganham Vitórias pelo Teste de Montagem, mas podem receber Vitórias por combates durante o Teste de Montagem.

### Dirigindo Descansos

Quando os heróis decidem fazer um Descanso (veja Descanso no Capítulo 1: O Básico), seu papel como Diretor muda um pouco. A maioria das atividades dos heróis durante descansos envolve projetos de tempo livre, que são tipicamente direcionados pelos personagens. Entretanto, você ainda tem alavancas que pode puxar para tornar a história interessante.

#### Lugar Seguro

Heróis não podem realizar um descanso a menos que estejam em um lugar seguro. Isso tipicamente significa um lugar com uma cama, quatro paredes e um teto sobre suas cabeças, onde provavelmente não serão atacados enquanto dormem. Os personagens não terão 24 horas de paz para realizar um descanso no covil de um vilão, mesmo que travem uma porta. Entretanto, isso pode se tornar uma área nebulosa se os heróis tentarem fazer um descanso enquanto viajam por terras selvagens.

"Por que não podemos acampar nessa Silva aparentemente pacífica por um dia?" é o tipo de coisa que você pode decidir que é aceitável se quiser que os personagens possam restaurar Vigor e Recuperações. Por outro lado, você pode querer que trabalhem mais duro por isso e marcar a Silva como um local perigoso na história. Se os jogadores querem que os heróis descansem em um local que você definiu com inseguro, deixe saberem que é impossível ter qualquer descanso significativo ou progresso em projetos porque estão constantemente vigiando por sinais de perigo.

#### Muitos Descansos?

Cabe aos jogadores decidir quantos descansos os heróis fazem consecutivamente. Personagens animados para fazerem uma longa série de descansos a fim de avançarem projetos de tempo livre (Capítulo 12) é aceitável, mas eles sempre devem sentir alguma pressão para voltar à luta. Lembre que vilões não param de conspirar e conquistar enquanto os heróis descansam. Seus planos continuam! Se os heróis estão levando o tempo que quiserem com descansos para que possam criar quantas Poções de Cura quiserem, faça que saibam das últimas ações malignas que os vilões estão realizando. Heróis querendo defender o povo e os valores que amam precisam parar de descansar e começar a aventurar.

Se você prefere uma campanha com poucos descansos, você pode querer adicionar artesãos, sábios e origens de projeto para permitir que heróis tenham chance de criar itens úteis ou fazer pesquisa, uma vez que seu tempo para isso será limitado.

#### Eventos de Projeto

Eventos de projeto de tempo livre são a hora do Diretor brilhar durante o tempo livre. Lembre que esses eventos (detalhados no Capítulo 12) são opcionais e você pode usá-los com a frequência que quiser. No geral, mais de um ou dois por descanso pode ser disruptivo à campanha. Tudo bem não ter eventos se você só quiser que a história principal da campanha siga em frente.

Ao dirigir eventos de tempo livre, garanta uma rotatividade de quais heróis estão no holofote da ação. Não concentre no mesmo herói várias e várias vezes. Você também pode fazer alguns preparativos para eventos antes de jogar, lendo a sugestão de evento e dando detalhes para virar uma cena. As sugestões são intencionalmente vagas para que você possa modificá-las como quiser ou criar as suas próprias com facilidade.

#### Descansos entre Sessões

Se seu tempo de jogo é limitado, você pode fazer com que os jogadores façam tudo que precisam fazer durante um descanso entre as sessões de jogo, desde que terminem uma sessão fazendo um descanso. Fazer isso permite dirigir quaisquer eventos por email ou um aplicativo de conversas. Enquanto, quando todos voltarem para a próxima sessão, estarão prontos para partir, com lançamentos de projeto concluídos, experiência calculada, além de Vigor e Recuperações restaurados.

#### Quantos Descansos?

Não há número certo de descansos que funciona para todos os grupos. Se você quiser que os personagens sejam capazes de criar e pesquisar, você precisará dar mais tempo livre para que o façam. Se prefere dar todos os Tesouros e segredos através de aventuras, então precisarão de menos descansos. Um bom ritmo para a maioria dos jogos é que os heróis façam entre 10 e 20 descansos a cada Nível de jogo, com vários desses descansos em sequências.

##### Vitórias e Descansos

No final das contas, os jogadores, não o Diretor, decidem quando os heróis realizam um descanso. Então mesmo que você julgue se as condições são seguras o bastante para um descanso, esta parte do ritmo da história está efetivamente fora de suas mãos. Tipicamente, a maioria dos heróis quer descansar depois de cerca de 4 a 6 Vitórias que recebem, dependendo de quantas Vitórias foram recebidas em encontros de combate.

#### Regra Opcional: Lançamento Médio

Quando os jogadores fizerem uma longa série de descansos, pode não ser divertido para que os jogadores façam vários lançamentos de dados cobrindo muitos projetos. Em vez disso, você pode calcular o progresso de cada descanso como se o herói tivesse obtido um 11 Natural no seu lançamento de progresso, para então adicionar os bônus adequados. Embora lançar muitos dados e torcer por Avanços possa ser bem divertido, obter a média do lançamento de 2d10 permite que jogadores passem por muito tempo livre com apenas o mínimo de matemática.

#### Regra Opcional: Criação Mais Fácil

Todo Projeto de Criação requer que um herói obtenha o item pré-requisito e uma origem do projeto em um idioma específico antes que o projeto possa ser iniciado. Esses requisitos existem para que você possa controlar o ritmo com o qual os heróis podem criar um arsenal de tesouros e outros itens ao mudar as regras para exigirem apenas o item pré-requisito ou origem do projeto, mas não ambos, ou ao remover as restrições de idioma em origens de projeto. Isto funciona bem em campanhas que não têm muitos descansos. Apenas tenha em mente que remover essas barreiras pode levar os heróis a fazerem mais itens e desequilibrar o jogo em favor deles.

### Concedendo Recompensas

Dar Tesouros, Renome, Riqueza e Títulos aos personagens deve ser tão divertido para você quanto receber essas recompensas o é para os jogadores (veja Capítulo 13: Recompensas). Mas qual a quantidade certa de Tesouro a dar sem tornar os heróis durões absolutos que podem simplesmente derrubar qualquer dragão que encontram? Com qual frequência as regras do jogo esperam que um herói receba Renome? E Títulos? Esta seção tem respostas para você!

### Concedendo Tesouros

Quando estiver planejando dar Tesouros aos heróis, concentre-se em itens que são úteis. Encontrar um arco mágico não vai ser muito excitante para um grupo que não tem um herói que adore combate com armas à distância. Os jogadores podem até falar (ou você pode perguntar) quais Tesouros seus heróis mais querem.

Uma vez que tenha Tesouros em mente, você pode usar a progressão a seguir como uma base para que os heróis recebam esses Tesouros:

- Um grupo deve receber dois Tesouros com Nível por herói até o 10º Nível. Alguns heróis precisam de apenas um Tesouro com Nível para ficarem felizes, então se você achar que outro Tesouro com Nível não ajudaria o personagem, você pode trocar esse item por um Adereço adequado ao Escalão do personagem.
- Um grupo deve receber um Adereço por herói por Escalão. Qualquer Adereço recebido deve ser do Escalão do personagem ou abaixo.
- Um grupo deve também receber de um a três Consumíveis de seu Escalão ou menor a cada Nível.

Você não precisa dar todos esses Tesouros aos heróis - especialmente para aqueles que estão usando seu tempo livre para criar coisas! Você pode intercalar o ritmo no qual personagens recebem Tesouros ao entregar origens de projeto e itens de pré-requisito para criar um item em vez de encontrar o objeto diretamente.

Ao planejar uma aventura, coloque os Tesouros e materiais de criação que os heróis podem ganhar no esboço do aventura (veja Criando Aventuras anteriormente neste capítulo). Inimigos que têm acesso a Tesouros que podem ajudá-los contra heróis não mantém esses Tesouros escondidos. Eles os usam em combate e os heróis vitoriosos podem então obter esses Tesouros!

##### Tesouros Acima de 1º Nível

Para uma campanha onde os heróis começam no 2º Nível ou acima, você pode dar a esses heróis os seguintes Tesouros iniciais:

- No 1º Escalão, cada herói começa com um Adereço de 1º Escalão.
- No 2º Escalão, cada herói começa com um Tesouro com Nível e um Adereço de 1º Escalão.
- No 3º Escalão, cada herói começa com dois Tesouros com Nível, um Adereço de 1º Escalão e um Adereço de 2º Escalão.
- No 4º Escalão, cada herói começa com dois Tesouros com Nível, um adereço de 1º Escalão, um Adereço de 2º Escalão e um Adereço de 3º Escalão.

Os jogadores podem escolher os Tesouros de seus heróis e substituir qualquer Tesouro com Nível ou Adereço por um Consumível do Escalão do herói ou abaixo.

### Criando Novos Tesouros

Você pode facilmente criar novos tipos de Tesouros com Nível para heróis encontrarem usando as melhorias do projeto Imbuir Tesouro no Capítulo 12: Projetos de tempo livre.

Você também pode escolher qualquer um dos Tesouros neste livro e facilmente alterar sua aparência. Você gostaria que as Luvas de Lagartixa fossem botas? Basta mudar a descrição, a palavra-chave Mãos e pronto. Você gostaria que a Marreta Congelante fosse uma adaga que cria poças de ácido em vez de um campo de gelo? Mude a palavra-chave Arma Pesada, troque o tipo de dano e tudo pronto! Simplesmente mudar palavras-chave, dano e descrições de Tesouros não vai quebrar o jogo.

### Concedendo Títulos

Você não precisa dar aos heróis cada Título para os quais se qualificam. Na verdade, você provavelmente não deve, senão eles ficarão poderosos demais rápido demais. Via de regra, um herói deve ganhar um novo Título em Níveis alternados, o que você pode conseguir com uma das opções a seguir:

- Você pode dar a um herói um Título durante um momento significativo em uma campanha, como após derrotar um vilão. Cada um dos heróis recebe um Título escolhido por você.
- Você pode permitir que um herói escolha um Título adequado entre as opções de Títulos disponíveis ao Escalão a cada vez que ele alcançar um Nível de número par.

Você deve falar com seus jogadores ocasionalmente para ver se há Títulos específicos que gostariam de obter, para então dar uma chance de obter esses Títulos. Fazer isso permite que os jogadores se envolvam mais na campanha e torna os personagens mais motivados a se aventurarem.

### Concedendo Renome

Os heróis ganham Renome sempre que fazem algo significativo, como salvar uma cidade ou...bem, salvar o mundo! De modo geral, heróis devem ganhar 1 ponto de Renome por Nível.

Se quiser que os personagens sejam menos famosos do que no conto heroico tradicional, você pode ajustar isso para dar Renome em Níveis alternados. Outra opção é dar Renome depois de cada aventura, se quiser que os heróis se tornem figuras importantes no mundo mais rapidamente.

#### Quantos Militantes?

Você pode definir limites para o número de militantes que os heróis podem ter a seu serviço. Para um grupo grande de heróis, ter muitos militantes pode tornar o combate complexo, longo e atrapalhado. Da mesma maneira, militantes são uma ótima forma de ajudar um grupo menor de heróis a lidar com desafios maiores. De modo geral, é uma boa ideia usar militantes para ajudar os heróis a terem um grupo de pelo menos quatro integrantes, mas não mais do que sete integrantes.

### Concedendo Riqueza

Os heróis ganham Riqueza sempre que forem bem pagos ou recuperarem uma montanha de tesouro. Personagens devem ganhar 1 ponto de Riqueza a cada dois Níveis.

### Concedendo Vales Heroicos

Você pode dar Vales Heroicos aos jogadores por tomarem riscos com seus personagens além do que o jogo tipicamente espera deles. Por exemplo, lutar contra um grupo de monstros é parte do jogo e não merece Vales Heroicos. Entretanto, as atividades a seguir podem merecer:

- Um herói fica sozinho contra um grupo de inimigos para permitir que seus parceiros fujam.
- Um herói voluntariamente pula em area movediça, lava ou perigo similar para salvar outro personagem.
- O grupo tem uma forma fácil de sair de uma situação difícil que envolve mentir, trapacear, roubar ou ações similares, mas escolhem o caminho honroso mais difícil.
- Um herói dá um recurso importante para alguém, como uma Poção de Cura, para ajudar outra criatura necessitada.

### Concedendo Vitórias

Use as orientações a seguir para dar Vitórias aos heróis, aumentando estes valores conforme o desejado para desafios notavelmente difíceis.

#### Encontros de Combate

Um encontro de combate bem-sucedido onde os objetivos do grupo são alcançados concede 1 Vitória a um herói. Encontros particularmente difíceis valem 2 Vitórias quando terminados com sucesso. _Draw Steel: Monstros_ tem mais informações sobre Vitórias e dificuldade de combate.

#### Testes de Montagem

Cada herói ganha 1 Vitória quando tiver sucesso total em um Teste de Montagem fácil ou médio e 2 Vitórias quando tiver sucesso total em um Teste de Montagem difícil. Um herói ganha 1 Vitória se tiver um sucesso parcial em um Teste de Montagem médio ou difícil.

#### Negociação

Cada herói ganha 1 Vitória se o grupo encerrar uma Negociação com o Interesse do NPC em 3 ou mais, com esse Interesse 2 pontos acima do valor no início da Negociação, e com um acordo feito.

#### Perigos e Armadilhas

Se os heróis superarem um perigo ou armadilha complicados que precisaram de múltiplos Testes para encontrar e sobreviver, cada herói ganha 1 Vitória.

#### Quebra-cabeças

Se os heróis resolverem um quebra-cabeça complicado que você acha que a maioria das pessoas levaria pelo menos 10 minutos para resolver, cada herói ganha 1 Vitória.

#### Objetivos de História

Se os heróis cumprirem um objetivo importante da história que cumpre uma missão, como salvar um príncipe preso por um barão maligno ou impedir que um necromante realize um ritual devastador, cada herói ganha 1 Vitória.

#### Esperteza

Se os heróis usarem esperteza para fácil e surpreendentemente superar ou contornar um encontro de combate, uma Negociação, um Teste de Montagem, uma armadilha, um quebra-cabeça ou outro desafio que teria concedido 1 ou mais Vitórias por um caminho mais difícil, dê a cada personagem a quantidade de Vitórias que teria recebido se tivesse enfrentado o problema diretamente.

## Campanha: Primeira Sessão

Ah, o cheiro de campanha nova! A primeira sessão de qualquer campanha de longo prazo é sobre deixar os jogadores empolgados, confortáveis e prontos para jogar. A primeira sessão de uma campanha é às vezes chamada "sessão zero" por conta de seu foco em preparação e criação de personagens - mas quando a criação está feita, você quer garantir que a sessão comece com o máximo de empolgação possível!

### Primeiro, Negócios

No início de sua primeira sessão, você tem alguns negócios para resolver antes de poder entrar na diversão de criar personagens.

#### Agenda

Fale com seus jogadores sobre o agendamento do jogo. Determine com o grupo a frequência de jogo, o que pretendem fazer quando um ou mais jogadores não puderem jogar e como vocês se comunicarão sobre o jogo quando não estiverem jogando.

#### Lidando com Disputas

Converse e decida como resolver disputas a respeito de regras. Nós recomendamos que você tome uma decisão no momento e então procure a regra depois da sessão para manter o fluxo de jogo.

#### Ferramentas de Segurança

Converse sobre as ferramentas de segurança que planeja usar na mesa. Para mais informações sobre ferramentas de segurança e uma lista de ferramentas de segurança que você pode usar em seus jogos, verifique o Kit de Segurança de RPGs de Mesa MCDM em https://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit.

#### Proposta de Campanha

Leia sua proposta de campanha novamente (veja o início deste capítulo) e responda quaisquer perguntas que os jogadores tenham sobre ela.

#### Sugestões dos Jogadores

Pergunte aos jogadores o que gostariam de ver na campanha e faça anotações sobre suas respostas. Isso pode incluir qualquer coisa desde "Eu adoraria ter algumas cenas de perseguição!" até "Eu quero explorar temas de perda e luto." Essas sugestões devem ser pontos de partida para uma conversa. Se nem todos os jogadores estiverem confortáveis com certos temas ou conteúdos desejados por outros jogadores, esta é uma ótima hora para discutir isso (voltando à sua discussão de ferramentas de segurança quando apropriado) e encontrar um consenso sobre o que todos querem com o jogo.

#### Regras da Casa

Converse sobre regras da casa que foram acordadas com os jogadores e pergunte se há qualquer regra que gostariam de adicionar. Regras da casa sempre devem ser discutidas com os jogadores, mas, no final das contas, você decide quais são usadas na campanha.

### Crie Heróis

Durante a primeira sessão de uma campanha nova, os jogadores provavelmente passarão a maior parte do tempo criando heróis. Enquanto o fazem, é uma boa ideia que você fique disponível para responder quaisquer perguntas que tenham sobre a campanha e o cenário. Eles podem perguntar sobre tudo desde o nome da cidade onde a primeira aventura começa, organizações importantes no jogo ou se um idioma ou Perícia serão úteis na campanha.

Enquanto seus jogadores criam seus heróis, você pode fazer anotações. É uma boa ideia anotar o nome, Linhagem, Antecedentes, Classe e Complicação (se houver) de cada herói. Também anote quaisquer detalhes importantes do histórico que um jogador compartilhar com você, como a cidade natal do personagem dele, os nomes de rivais, entes queridos, inimigos e quaisquer organizações com as quais se envolveram.

### Comece com um Estrondo

Quando tudo está feito, é uma ótima ideia jogar uma cena inicial durante sua primeira sessão - idealmente uma cena que inclua um encontro de combate. Este primeiro encontro deve dar aos jogadores uma prova da campanha deliciosa que você está cozinhando para eles e deixá-los mais empolgados para a próxima sessão.

Seu encontro de abertura deve introduzir ou dar pistas do vilão que os heróis enfrentarão durante sua primeira aventura. Você pode usar qualquer uma das ideias de encontro a seguir para começar:

- Enquanto viajavam ao povoado onde sua primeira aventura vai ocorrer, os heróis e sua caravana ou navio são atacados por bandidos.
- Os heróis entram em uma nova cidade e encontram Cães de Guerra (veja _Draw Steel: Monstros_) prontos para executar publicamente um nobre que se recusou a obedecer ao tirano brutal Ajax.
- Os heróis estão em uma taberna aproveitando a noite quando um bando de invasores Gnoll ataca e incendeia o local.
- Os heróis estão acampando em um pântano quando mortos-vivos emergem da lama e os cercam.
- Enquanto assistem a uma peça de teatro, um ator (talvez por acidente) realiza um ritual que abre um portal para o Deserto Abissal e invoca uma horda de demônios.

O encontro que você fizer deve ter relação com a primeira aventura que planeja dirigir. Mantenha este encontro simples e deixe que cada jogador se acostume a dirigir seu herói. Você pode sempre ter alguns reforços vilanescos chegando caso o encontro seja fácil demais!

Se ainda tiver tempo sobrando, você pode continuar jogando um pouco mais, podendo expandir o encontro de combate ou adicionar um pouco de exploração ou viagem. Caso contrário, encerre o combate, agradeça aos jogadores por uma ótima primeira sessão e comece a planejar sua próxima sessão.
